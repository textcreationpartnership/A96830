    _ The IV. Article of Tilenus. That God to ſave his Elect from the corrupt Maſs, doth beget faith in them by a power equall to that, whereby he created the world, and raiſed up the dead, inſomuch that ſuch unto whom he gives that Grace, cannot reject
 it; and the reſt being Reprobate cannot accept of it, &c.

    _ The fift Article of Tilenus. That ſuch as have once received that Grace by Faith, can never fall from it finally, or totally, notwithſtanding the moſt enormous ſins they can commit. How doth M. Baxter reſent this Article? Why, 'tis feigned, and (Tilenus) his own abuſive language. One would think by theſe expreſſions, that the man did diſclaim the Doctrine. But alas! 'tis onely a copy of his countenance (as ſhall appeare afterwards;) for the Calviniſts do conſtantly maintain, Such as have once received that Grace, can never fall from it, finally or totally; Witneſſe,
