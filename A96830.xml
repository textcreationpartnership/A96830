            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Have finiſht the task, to which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your <hi>haeſitation</hi> or <hi>curioſity</hi> did more earneſtly ſolicite me, I ſhall not determine. A task, I confeſſe, ſo much the more unpleaſing, as I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conceive it the leſſe needfull. For (to tell you the truth,) 'tis the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Judicious men, that your great <hi>Champion</hi> comes off, in this incounter, with as little reputation, (though he falls on with as much ſcorn and paſſion) as the Proud <hi>Philiſtine</hi> in his Combate with little <hi>David.</hi> Indeed he makes out very fierce and frequent
<pb facs="tcp:116027:4"/> 
               <hi>Sallies</hi> upon the face of our <hi>Tilenus,</hi> and defies him utterly in the bittereſt aſperity of foul Language: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he does him the honour to leave him Maſter of the Field, and expoſeth his own Cauſe to the danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyd by his own weapons. I do not impute this to any want of skill or met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in him; for his abilities have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves ſufficient to advance him above the pitch of contemptible, would he be carefull to manage them with that Prudence and Chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that becomes a faithfull Souldier of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> minding nothing more than the intereſt of his Church. But forgetting his duty herein, like a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of <hi>fortune,</hi> who lives by warrs, or ſome young Gallant fleſht by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of an <hi>Aggreſſor,</hi> whom he hath worſted upon advantage, he is apt to have a hand in every quarrell; and though he be not ſatisfied in the grounds of the difference, yet rather than take up the diſpute, and make men friends, he will take a <hi>ſide</hi> and make a <hi>Party.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:116027:4"/> That he hath done thus in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie is evident to every impartiall Reader, that is converſant in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.

            <p>When the <hi>Jewes</hi> met with any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, for which they could finde no competent <hi>ſolution,</hi> they were wont to ſay, that <hi>Elias</hi> would come; and when he came, he would <hi>untie</hi> all ſuch knots, and unravell ſuch intricacies, ſcatter the cloud, and adminiſter a clear light of ſatisfaction. It was the deſire of my ſoul that God would vouchſafe to ſend ſome ſuch <hi>Elias,</hi> as might be able to diſintangle the intricacies of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:116027:7"/> Controverſies; and why, thought I, may not this Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> be the man? though I muſt adde withall, that too many Reaſons throng'd in on a ſudden, and offered themſelves to oppoſe that thought, and did actually check and ſilence it.</p>
            <p>At laſt forth comes the <hi>Examination</hi> of <hi>Tilenus;</hi> and by that means, I thought, a faire <hi>Price</hi> was now put into Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> hand, or rather a handſome invitation and an opportunity offered to him, to ſhew his wiſdome. But what was the <hi>Reſult</hi> of it? He took the <hi>bait,</hi> but one would think, by his mere <hi>nibbling</hi> at it, that he was affraid, there was a <hi>hook</hi> too ſharp for him, either to ſwallow or dally with.</p>
            <p>In earneſt, (becauſe you are ſo very urgent to gain my opinion of it) I tell you, though I finde little abatement of the <hi>confidence</hi> he profeſt, yet I can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing of the <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> he boaſted himſelf able to accompliſh; for indeed his <hi>Arrogance</hi> flew ſo high a pitch, that it flew to <hi>Leſſening;</hi> he could not ſee the
<pb facs="tcp:116027:7"/> 
               <hi>game</hi> he had undertaken; if he had, he would never have offered his <hi>ſecurity</hi> to perform that, whereof in his very next <hi>line,</hi> he ſaith <hi>[But I know this is to be expected from none but God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the ſaid Praeface.</note>]</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay then, that he was ſo nice and chary of his <hi>healing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> that he would not affoard the Church of God their Benefit? I dare not think him ſo uncharitable. He tels us, I remember, (in his forementioned <hi>Poſtſcript) I am not onely diſtracted between mens contrary Judgements and deſires: but far more, between a fear of wronging the Church by miſtakes, and of wronging it by my ſilence, and Chriſt by hiding my Talent and his precious Truths, which after hard ſtudy and earneſt ſupplication, he revealed to me on theſe terms, that I ſhould reveale them to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope mens <hi>contrary Judgements</hi> did not ſtill hold M. <hi>Baxter</hi> in <hi>diſtraction,</hi> (from <hi>November</hi> 12. 1650. till <hi>April</hi> 14. 1658.) when he wrote againſt <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus;</hi> and ſure we may conclude <hi>[his
<pb facs="tcp:116027:8"/> fear of wronging the Church by miſtakes]</hi> was blown over, when he made this proclamation to the world. 1657. viz. <hi>[And to the Praiſe of God I ſpeak it,</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:116027:8"/>
            <p>What then, have we all, or the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of all, that Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> hath to reveal for the worlds ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in theſe Controverſies?

But whoſe fault is this? Why, he was now in purſuit after <hi>Tilenus,</hi> and ſo engaged to leave his own <hi>Method,</hi> that he might trace <hi>his</hi> Adverſarie by his ſteps. But grant this to be true, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that Part of his <hi>Preface,</hi> (from <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. to 17.) wherein he had concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf againſt <hi>Tilenus;</hi> yet when he came to <hi>review</hi> the ſeverall heads of Controverſie (from <hi>Section</hi> 28. to the end,) he was then at Liberty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his <hi>Principles</hi> as himſelf pleaſed; why did he not then give us his own <hi>Method with Evidence,</hi> but put Maſter <hi>P.</hi> off by playing his old <hi>Notes</hi> over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

            <p>If you object, that I have not made good Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> juſt demand, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his <hi>Principles</hi> an <hi>Impartiall Reception according to their Evidence;</hi> if you pleaſe you ſhall have my <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> that I am verily perſuaded, I have done it; and whether I have or no, is referred to the Reader to judge by this Reply.

            <p>I am not ſatisfied, that his <hi>diſtinctions</hi> to avoid the <hi>Poſsibility</hi> of ſin, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to avoid the making God the <hi>Author</hi> of it. For thus he ſaith<note n="†" place="margin">Edit. the firſt.</note>, <hi>pag.</hi> 91. <hi>Becauſe it belongs to the Univerſality of the firſt cauſe to produce not onely every reall being, but alſo the reall poſitive Modifications of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; therefore we ſay, that in good works, both the works themſelves, and their recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are poſitive, and are from God; in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill works there are alſo two things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the works themſelves, and their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie; the works themſelves we doubt not, are poſitive, and from God, as all other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive things</hi> (are); <hi>but their pravities adde no new entities to them, but conſiſt in a mere privation.</hi> Thus Maſter <hi>Hickman.</hi> In reference to <hi>ſinfull</hi> Actions, others deliver the <hi>diſtinction</hi> in <hi>theſe</hi> termes, (telling us,) [The ſinfull Act is to be conſidered, either <hi>Materialiter,</hi> as to the matter of it, and ſo it is from God, and of his production; or elſe <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> as to the Form of it, and ſo it is from man. But we ſhould remember,

<pb facs="tcp:116027:16"/> law is ſinne?

Indeed were there no Law in force about it, it were poſſible to conceive, how he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth (that which we now call) the Act of ſin <hi>materially,</hi> ſhould not, for all that, be the <hi>formall</hi> cauſe of it. But the law being now made, and that by God himſelf too, what <hi>Subterfuge</hi> can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to avoid it, but that God, who is affirmed to produce the Act, ſhould be accounted the Author of the ſinne? But God made the Law, you will ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:116027:16"/> not to bind <hi>himſelf,</hi> but to regulate his Creature; Though this be true, yet it doth not take away the objection; for how can it ſtand with the juſtice of God, firſt to make a Law to <hi>regulate</hi> his creature, and then to <hi>impell</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> that creature <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>that</hi> Law, and at laſt to puniſh the <hi>ſame</hi> Creature, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſo</hi> Acted and impeld? <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> Gen. 18.26. <hi>God will be juſtified when he judgeth</hi>

            <p>But Maſter <hi>Hickman</hi> perhaps, will ſtick ſtill to his <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> formality, and ſay, here is (in the ſuppoſed Act) a diſcrepance or oppoſition to the Rule which is the Law of God. To this the anſwer is very eaſie, that man ſeldome, or never entertains ſin, or conſent to it, with a deſign or minde to oppoſe
<pb facs="tcp:116027:17"/> himſelf to the divine Law; but for the moſt part to enjoy his pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Appetites; (Beſides if he ſhould <hi>conſent</hi> to ſin, with ſuch a ſet <hi>purpoſe</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> Gods Law; yet we muſt grant, according to Maſter <hi>Hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Doctrine, that that <hi>Conſent,</hi> and that <hi>purpoſe</hi> (being <hi>reall poſitive</hi> Entities, <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Humane</hi> Soul) are from God and of his production;) whence it follows ſtill, either that man doth not ſin when he commits ſuch an Act, or, if he doth ſin, that the fault is to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon God, who is the firſt Cauſe of that Act.</p>

Therefore <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He cannot <hi>omit</hi> the Act, for that is of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; nor <hi>avoid</hi> the obliquity, for that is either to be done by ſome <hi>other</hi> Act, or <hi>without</hi> it.

            <p>If Maſter <hi>Hickman</hi> holds the <hi>negative</hi> of that Queſtion; the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Divines of the Synod are againſt him; and a world of abſurdities do follow that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man cannot <hi>bury</hi> his Talent, nor receive the grace of God in <hi>vain,</hi> nor be <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> the great Salvation; nor <hi>watch,</hi> nor <hi>faſt,</hi> nor <hi>pray,</hi> nor do any <hi>one</hi> good <hi>duty</hi> more then he doth, nay, that he can do <hi>no</hi> duty <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſo called, nor <hi>ſin</hi> at all, if he be thus chaind by a <hi>Fatall</hi> neceſſity to every <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>omiſsion.</hi> And then what will become of the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>exhortation</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſſe?</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:116027:21"/> But how much doth Maſter <hi>Hickman</hi> make man better?

Truely he ſeems very fairely to grant it, if I be able to underſtand him; whether this be out of <hi>inadvertency,</hi> or <hi>conviction,</hi> I determine not: But in contradiction to what he had ſaid before, he ſaith (Pag. 97.) <hi>Suppoſe the firſt ſin of Angels to have been a proud deſire to be equall unto God; the</hi> cauſe <hi>of this proud deſire was the</hi> will <hi>of the Angel; but it was the</hi> Cauſe <hi>of the action (in ſuch a ſenſe as a cauſality may be ſaid to have a Cauſe)</hi> Per ſe, <hi>of the vitioſity of the action, it was onely the Cauſe</hi> Per accidens, &amp; per concomitantiam.

            <p>And now, as <hi>Poelenburg</hi> ſaith of Doctor <hi>Twiſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In confut. Diſp. inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur. Fred.

               <hi>This</hi> Doctrine attributes to Almighty God, a <hi>power,</hi> not onely <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> he preſcribes, and the <hi>Promiſes</hi> he makes unto his ſervants, but <hi>Paramount</hi> to his own <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> Equity; For <hi>it</hi> ſaith, he may <hi>ordain,</hi> yea that he hath <hi>ordained</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> part of Mankinde to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>merely</hi> for his own pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>intuition</hi> of <hi>any</hi> ſin, or reſpect had to <hi>any</hi> demerit in <hi>them.</hi> It makes God like an <hi>unwiſe</hi> Potter, who makes ſome <hi>veſſels</hi> on purpoſe, that he may <hi>daſh</hi> them all to <hi>pieces.</hi> It teacheth, that of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom he found no <hi>Diſparity</hi> of condition, he hath <hi>elected</hi> ſome, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> others; and that he introduced a <hi>neceſsity</hi> of ſinning for the <hi>illuſtration</hi> of his glory. How ſhall we reconcile <hi>theſe</hi> things to Gods <hi>wiſdome,</hi> or his <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It teacheth, that God elected men to glory <hi>without</hi> Chriſt: but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed through the <hi>intervention</hi> of Chriſts
<pb facs="tcp:116027:25"/> death, to bring them into <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of that glory, that it might be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>detriment</hi> to his Juſtice. But this is either againſt the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of God, if he decreed what he <hi>ought not</hi> to execute, or againſt his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnipotence,</hi> if he <hi>could not</hi> bring the <hi>ſame</hi> to execution.</p>
            <p>It teacheth, that God ſent Chriſt to <hi>reconcile</hi> men to himſelf, <hi>whom</hi> he loved with a moſt <hi>deer</hi> and <hi>unchangeable</hi> love, and that <hi>before</hi> he <hi>decreed</hi> to give Chriſt to die for them; That he <hi>Courts</hi> others to be <hi>reconciled,</hi> whom he <hi>hates</hi> immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; That he calls <hi>them</hi> to repentance, inlightens <hi>them,</hi> gives <hi>them</hi> a <hi>taſte</hi> of the heavenly gift, and zeal to do good works; and <hi>all</hi> this to ſerve but for a <hi>golden</hi> chariot to conduct them with the more <hi>formality</hi> to a ſadder execution; That he <hi>bindes</hi> ſome men to <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, for whom <hi>he</hi> never died; That he <hi>invites</hi> them to a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>ties</hi> them to <hi>impoſsible</hi> conditions under it, that he may inflict the <hi>greater</hi> torments upon them; That <hi>ſome</hi> mens
<pb facs="tcp:116027:26"/> ſins, (of what nature ſoever,) are but <hi>paternall</hi> caſtigations, <hi>Priviledges</hi> of their <hi>Adoption,</hi> Emergences of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for their <hi>benefit,</hi> Confirmations of their grace, and that they do <hi>pave</hi> their way to glory, being part of that <hi>Medium</hi> conducing to the <hi>execution</hi> of the Decree of <hi>Election</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine <hi>implyes</hi> moreover, that <hi>God</hi> is more <hi>ſevere</hi> to the greateſt part of <hi>mankind</hi> than to <hi>Devils;</hi> That <hi>they</hi> cannot pray but for their <hi>own</hi> damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that the divine <hi>Decrees</hi> may be reſcinded; That <hi>others</hi> living in the <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyeſt</hi> ſins, may notwithſtanding be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of their ſalvation, and need not <hi>fear</hi> hell-torments; for <hi>their</hi> ſins ſhall not be able to <hi>ſeparate</hi> betwixt God and them; contrary to the expreſſe word of <hi>God</hi> by his Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi>

            <p>In the mean time, <hi>I</hi> muſt acquaint you further, that theſe very <hi>five</hi> Articles (word for word, as near as they could be tranſlated) were drawn up by <hi>Daniel Tilenus</hi> himſelf (and not his <hi>Ghost</hi>) who was as like to know, and as able to ſtate the difference and controverſies betwixt the Remonſtrants and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries as any other. The truth is, he wrote a ſmall <hi>Tract</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> which was tranſlated about 30. years ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Engliſh by one of his own countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (a Parſon of a Church in London)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116027:41"/> Maſter <hi>John L'oiſeau,</hi> aliàs <hi>Tourvail:</hi> This, being put into a very mean dreſſe (the Tranſlators skill in the Engliſh tongue not able to furniſh better) was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome years ſince, as <hi>I</hi> am informed, (for a printed copy <hi>I</hi> have not ſeen, though <hi>I</hi> have had the peruſall of one in Manuſcript) under another Title; viz. <hi>[Presbyterian Doctrine.]</hi> Whereas the Title prefixed by the ſaid M. <hi>J.

Sententiae. tranſlated into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, page 40, 41.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That God hath Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the ſalvation of ſome particular men by his mercy or grace, and the condemnation of others by his juſtice, without any ſight or intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this decree, of righteouſneſſe, or ſin; obedience, or diſobedience; that might proceed from either of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſſe this his preceding decree, determined the creation of <hi>Adam</hi> and all men in him, in the right ſtate of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall righteouſneſſe, and further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that they ſhould ſin, and ſo be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116027:43"/> deprived of originall righteouſneſſe, and become guilty of eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That God hath decreed thoſe (whom he would preciſely ſave) as to ſalvation, ſo to the means appertaining thereunto, to bring them to faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it; and this indeed by his irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible grace, and power, ſo as they cannot but believe, perſevere, and be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That God hath decreed to deny unto them whom, in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will, he hath preordained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and accordingly doth not conferre that grace which is ſufficient and neceſſary to ſalvation; ſo as they are neither able to believe, neither can they be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Jacobus Arminius</hi> drew up the Articles; who as he was a man of too great integrity to impoſe upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary or his Reader, ſo is he known to be of too great learning and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to encounter with ſhadows and

               <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of his own imagination.</p>
            <p>How this Doctrine of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is held forth by the other ſort of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pralapſarians</hi> and the <hi>Sublapſarians,</hi> he that deſires to be fully ſatisfied, may procure his ſatisfaction at an eaſie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe both of time and money, if he will conſult that ſmall <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated and lately ſet forth by Maſter <hi>Tobias Conyers,</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116027:44"/> Authors in other points of Religion, we ſhall finde <hi>the fall</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> not poſſibly otherwaies conſiderable,<note place="margin">

               <p>That this unavoidable neceſſity <hi>to do,</hi> or <hi>not to do good</hi> or <hi>evill,</hi> is (according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) from Gods <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall praedeſtination, and effectuall ſecret decree,</hi> appears ſufficiently by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies already alledged, to which I will adde but two or three.</p>

Although it be manifeſt to us, in the generall and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, or at leaſt it may be manifeſt to us by Gods word, that we can neither do more good then we do, nor omit more evill then we do omit; becauſe God hath preciſely decreed from all eternity, that both ſhall ſo come to paſſe; yet becauſe 'tis not manifeſt to us <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> definitely and in ſpeciall manner, how much God hath decreed, that we ſhould doe or omit, we cannot be juſtly accounted fooliſh if we do perpetually endeavour, to do more good then we do, and likewiſe to omit more evill then we omit.

               <p>And to ſecond <hi>Piſcator</hi> in this opinion, <hi>Maccovius</hi> doth moſt fiercely maintain it in a Diſputation of nine or ten pages long. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg.

               <p>A Second <hi>Corollary,</hi> drawn by others from that <hi>Unavoidable Neceſſity</hi> fore-mentioned, is this:</p>

                  <hi>Donteclock.</hi> We conclude therefore, that all the care, ſtudy and diligence, which men can uſe to promote their ſalvation is vain and to no purpoſe, rather hurtfull then profitable, before faith and the ſpirit of renovation. But after faith and converſion they are clearly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and profitable. <hi>Adverſus Castell. p.</hi> 171.

He is the meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation, and our Ranſome. But of two alike ſinfull, he is not the cauſe why the one is preferred before the other. The Cauſe is to be ſought in Gods beneplaciture and free love, which in order goes before the interceſſion of the Son. For the Father ſent the Son and gave him to be the Redeemer. <hi>This is his Anſwer to that Queſtion,</hi> [whether Chriſt be the Foundation of Election?] which is negative.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If you inquire, whether the elect be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved out of Chriſt; they are at odds here too, for ſome of them ſay,</p>
               <p>When we affirme that the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whereby he choſe us, goes in order before the interceſſion of the Son, our meaning is not, that the elect are beloved of God, out of Chriſt; For though the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went before the ſending of his Son, yet he never loved us but in conſideration of his Son, neither would he ever confer any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit upon the elect, but in and through his Son. <hi>Pet. Molin. ubi ſupra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the Synod rejects it as an errour in them, who teach, that <hi>Chriſt neither could nor
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116027:65"/> ought to die for thoſe, whom God dearly loved, and choſe unto eternall life, ſeeing ſuch ſtood in no need of Chriſts death. Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Reject.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 253. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>Act. Syn. Dord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus</hi> ſaith, We do not teach that God by his abſolute will and decree, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to ſin, hath ordained any to damnation. But we ſay, God would declare his iuſtice in the damnation of the Reprobate; and therefore he would not appoint any to damnation but for ſin. <hi>Act. Syn. Dord. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And the Divines of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> ſay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or Non-election is Gods eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, whereby, for his own moſt free good pleaſure, he determined not to have mercy upon ſome perſons <hi>faln</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo farre forth, as to deliver them effectually, from the ſtate of miſery, by Chriſt, and bring them infallibly unto bleſſedneſſe. <hi>De Reprob.

               <p>But <hi>Gomarus</hi> ſaith, God had no reſpect at all to ſin, as going before it, in the Decree of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116027:66"/> Reprobation. For, <hi>ſaith He,</hi> Peremptory Reprobation is the Decree of God, whereby, for his own moſt free pleaſure, to the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his avenging juſtice, he determined to give neither grace nor glory to certain men, out of univerſall mankind, but to ſuffer them freely to <hi>fall</hi> into ſin, and to leave them in their ſins, and at laſt juſtly to condemn them for their ſinnes. <hi>ibid. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 24. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.

               </p>
               <p n="5">V. If you inquire concerning the Act of Reprobation; whether it be Negative onely, or Negative and Affirmative alſo; The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodiſts are not all of one minde in this point neither.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Haſſien Divines</hi> ſay, The Divines of the Reformed Churches do think, we muſt accurately diſtinguiſh betwixt the two Acts of Reprobation, whereof one is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>viz.</hi> The purpoſe of God not to have mercy, or preterition: The other affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> his purpoſe to damn, or ordination to deſtruction as a juſt puniſhment. <hi>Act. Syn. Dor. pag.</hi> 33. <hi>part.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And the Churches of <hi>Wedderav.</hi> There are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116027:66"/> two acts of Reprobation; Preterition, or Non-election, and Damnation, or preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of puniſhment. <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 40. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>item pag.</hi> 45. <hi>th.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But the Divines of Great <hi>Britain</hi> were of another opinion. For they ſay, The proper acts of reprobation as it is oppoſed to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we think to be no other, then the deniall of the ſame glory and the ſame grace, which are prepared for the children of God in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And in the Decree of election, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, for them, Glory and effectuall Grace, and with that intention, that it ſhould be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall: that is, that by ſuch grace, they may be brought, infallibly, to the ſaid Glory. That ſuch Grace and Glory is prepared for the Reprobates, we deny. <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 11. <hi>a. m.</hi>

               <p>Theſe differences we obſerve amongſt them in matters that relate to <hi>Tilenus</hi> his <hi>firſt</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. So in reference to the <hi>Second</hi> Article; If you inquire,</p>
               <p n="1">I. Whether Chriſt hath dyed for <hi>All,</hi> or onely for the <hi>Elect;</hi> you will finde them (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſeem to ſay in the full Synod) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Chamber Practice, to contradict one another; For the Divines of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain do determine, That,</p>
               <p>God, pitying mankind, faln, ſent his Son, who gave himſelf a price of Redemption (or

                  <hi>Martinius</hi> giving in his <hi>Suffrage,</hi> upon this Article, <hi>doth reſolve thus.</hi> There is a certain <hi>Philanthropy</hi> of God, whereby he loves all mankinde fal'n, and ſeriouſly would have them all to be ſaved, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 103. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Th.</hi> 8. If this Redemption be not ſuppoſed as a common benefit beſtowed upon all: that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and promiſcuous preaching of the Goſpell, committed to the Apoſtles, to be performed amongſt All nations, will have no true foundation. (<hi>Et theſ.</hi> 9.) And ſeeing we abhorre to ſay this; it is to be conſidered, how much they ſpeak againſt moſt clear and known principles, who, at their pleaſure, do plainly deny, that Chriſt died for all men. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 10. Neither will it ſatisfie to propoſe ſuch a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, as might be enough; but ſuch as is altogether enough in God's and Chriſt's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For otherwiſe the command and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpell will be overthrown.</p>
               <p>For (<hi>Theſ.</hi> 11.) from a benefit, that is ſufficient indeed, but not deſigned for me by a true intention, how can there be deduced a neceſſity of my believing it, to belong unto me? And <hi>Theſ.</hi> 26. he gives the chief Reaſons which induced him to be of this opinion, which are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Scriptures might be reconciled without wreſting.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:116027:67"/>
               <p n="2">2. That the Glory of Gods truth, mercy and juſtice, in the commands, promiſes and threatnings of the Goſpell, might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; leſt by theſe God ſhould be thought to will and do ſomething otherwiſe then the words ſignifie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it may be manifeſt, that the blame of the deſtruction of the wicked may be in themſelves, not in the defect of a remedy, by which they might be ſaved. Thus <hi>Martini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſent to the Synod from <hi>Breme, Act. Syn. Dord. part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 104. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Ludovicus Crocius</hi> another of the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Divines, ſets down his opinion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the ſame purpoſe, though not ſo well, or ſo fully (as M. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth intimate) See <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 117. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>But the Divines of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> were of another judgement; for they ſay; That the generall love of God to ſinners is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But that Love is more excellent, which moved God to give his Son to ſave us from our ſins. This is not generall but ſpeciall, not common to all and every man, but proper to the elect. <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 83.</p>
               <p>And the Divines of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; Chriſt, out of the Fathers good pleaſure merely, was deſtin'd and given to be Mediator and Head to a certain number of men, conſtituting his body Myſticall, by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116027:68"/> Gods election. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 100. <hi>&amp; Theſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>For theſe, Chriſt, who beſt underſtood his own office, would and decreed to die, and to adde the infinite price of his death, a ſingular and moſt effectuall intention of his will.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iſelburg</hi> ſaith, Chriſt died, or laid down his life, for all and every one of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſheep or Faithfull, and in their ſtead, and for their good onely. <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 111. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And the Miniſters of <hi>Emden</hi> ſay, Chriſt according to the intention, counſil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his Father, died onely for the Elect. <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 119. <hi>q.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Belgic</hi> Profeſſors ſay, If you conſider the proper end, and the ſingular and ſaving efficacie of Chriſt's death, we affirm that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Fathers and his own counſil, Jeſus Chriſt died, not for the Reprobates and thoſe that periſh, but onely for the Elect, and thoſe that do believe. <hi>Act. Syn. Dor. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 88. <hi>f.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Brethren of North-Holland ſay, The Scripture ſaith Chriſt died for All, that is, for All the Elect out of all ſorts of men. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 107. <hi>&amp; p.</hi> 108. They ſay, That of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants is falſe, that the intention of the Father, delivering his Son to death, and of the Son in undergoing death, was, that by the ſame he might ſave all and every one, though
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116027:68"/> through the fault of many of them the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happens otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Brethren of <hi>Zeeland</hi> offer theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (ſuch as they are) againſt Chriſt's death for all, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 112. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. If Chriſt paid a price of Redemption for all and every man, then All and every one ought to be ſaved, and none to periſh.</p>
               <p>But this is falſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If reconciliation with God, and remiſſion of ſins be impetrated for all and every man, then the word of reconciliation is alſo to be preached to all and every one. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent is falſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deputies of the Synod of <hi>Groningen</hi> ſay, we do believe, that according to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's intention, delivering his Son to death, and the Son's, in ſuffering it, reconciliation with God and remiſſion of ſins is obtained onely for the elect. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 138.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of the Synod of <hi>Gallo-Belgia</hi> ſay, That according to the Scripture, Chriſt really died for none, but believers. And the will of the Father in ſending his Son, and of the Son in dying was no other. <hi>Pag.</hi> 151. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of the Synod of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> ſhall conclude this part of the contradiction; and the Reader ſhall have their very Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes, that he may learn <hi>Logick</hi> with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:116027:69"/>
               <p>Whoſoever God calls to ſalvation, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the death of Chriſt, for them Chriſt died. But God calls not every man to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, purchaſed by the death of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt dyed not for all.</p>
               <p>Whomſoever God commands to believe in Chriſt crucified, for them Chriſt dyed. God does not command every man to believe in Chriſt crucified. <hi>Ergo. ibid. pag.</hi> 93.</p>
               <p n="2">II. If we inquire who then the <hi>Impetration</hi> of Reconciliation be to be ſeparated from the <hi>Application</hi> of it, we find them at <hi>Boy's</hi> play, <hi>at Heads and Hollies,</hi> here too; for ſome are for the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> as</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martinius.</hi> That externall Calling doth neceſſarily require, as going before it, theſe things; the promiſe and ſending of the Son, and the paying of a Ranſome to take away ſin, and God ſo appeaſed, that he requires no other ſacrifice of any man for ſin, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that moſt full one <hi>(of Chriſts,)</hi> and that there be no need of any other merit or ſatisfaction, for mans reconciliation, ſo that (which ought to be done in all remedies) there be an application of the medicine <hi>Act. Syn. Dord. part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 104. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; theſ.</hi> 23. Chriſt hath merited for all God's favour, to be really obtained, if they do believe, and ſo by Gods favour righteouſneſſe and life. (and <hi>Theſ.</hi> 24.) This his favour God commonly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116027:69"/> declareth by his Goſpel: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (becauſe he keeps the merits of his Son in his own power, as being given and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, not by us, but by himſelfe) he takes order it ſhall be publiſhed, to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and eſpecially by that means it is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in whom, when, and how far he pleaſes: <hi>&amp; Theſ.</hi> 25. Hence it is manifeſt, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or impetration, and the application, are and are not, of an equall latitude, in a diverſe reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ludovicus Crocius</hi> is of the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too. <hi>

               <p>But theſe two great lights of the Church of <hi>Breme</hi> (as far as I can obſerve, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) are eclipſed by the Negative <hi>Suffrages</hi> of all the reſt of that Synod. But firſt let us heare the judgement of <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> inſerted amongſt the Acts of the Synod, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 292.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sectaries,</hi> ſaith <hi>He,</hi> pretend, that Chriſt by his death, hath impetrated reconciliation and remiſſion of ſins for all and every man: which is preſt with ſo many Inconveniences, ſaith He, and draws ſo many wicked abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities after it, that it is a wonder, they can ſtrive againſt it. <hi>Et paulo poſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is manifeſtly illuded by this Doctrine: <hi>and after,</hi> Thus God is not onely illuded, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:116027:70"/> He himſelf is feigned to illude mankind. And, in ſhort, he concludes, that this <hi>impetration</hi> (as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Application</hi>) is <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Divines of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſay, That, it is an evident errour in the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> that they do divide and ſever the <hi>impetration,</hi> and <hi>application</hi> of the benefits of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeverall objects: and not judge them to be applyed to all thoſe for whom they are impetrated. <hi>Act.

               <p>But the judgement of the Brethren of <hi>North-Holland</hi> is otherwiſe; for they ſay, That the blindneſſe of mans mind in ſpirituall matters is ſo great, that although the Goſpel be preached to him, yet without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall illumination of the Holy Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand the ſenſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. <hi>175.</hi> &amp; p. <hi>170.</hi> m.</note> neceſſary to be known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, hoped in, and practiſed.

And the Deputies of the Synod of <hi>Groning</hi> do affirm, That an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, that is, conſidered in the fall, hath nothing in him, whereby he is able to diſpoſe himſelf unto ſupernaturall good. The Holy Ghoſt doth expreſly deny, that man, by the light and gifts of nature remaining in him,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>206,</hi>
                  </note> may be raiſed to the true knowledge of God.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>219.</hi>
                  </note> To the ſame purpoſe do the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Synod of <hi>Gallo-Belgia</hi> expreſſe themſelves; In the ſtate of ſin, ſay they, the naturall man is blinde; and perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; and that not onely becauſe he is unable to find them out before their Revelation; but alſo becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are revealed to him, he cannot ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand, or yield aſſent unto them, without the internall illumination of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit and ſpeciall grace.</p>
               <p>Again if you inquire, whether the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate be able to do any thing, that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their comfort in gaining aſſurance of their election and regeneration; The Synod doth at leaſt imply it, in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination Artic.</hi> 16. where they ſay, That thoſe, who do not as yet effectually perceive in themſelves a lively faith, or a ſure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of heart in Chriſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as theſe ought not to be caſt down at the mention of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116027:72"/> Reprobation, nor reckon themſelves among the reprobate; but muſt diligently go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the uſe of thoſe means, by which, God hath promiſed, that he will work theſe things in us, and ardently deſire and humbly and reverently expect the good hour of more plentifull grace. If this doth not imply a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in them to doe ſo, as is here directed, they do but trifle to no purpoſe but to blind the Reader.</p>
               <p>That they ſpeak here of the unregenerate appears, 1. Becauſe they propound the caſe of the Regenerate, in the infancy of their Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in the words following, and ſure they would not be guilty of ſo groſſe a Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology, as to repeat the ſame thing twice in one Article. 2. Becauſe if this doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the unregenerate, there is no light of hope in the Article, no not ſo much as for the Elect, that are yet in an unregenerate ſtate; and ſurely they would not be ſo negligent as to omit proviſion for their incouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duty, which therefore muſt needs be this, <hi>they muſt uſe the means, &amp;c.</hi> And yet to aſſert that the unregenerate hath any ſuch power, this is rejected as an errour, that had troubled the Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For that an unregenerate man is not properly, nor totally dead in ſins, nor deſtitute of all ſtrength tending to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, but that he is able to hunger and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116027:73"/> thirſt after righteouſneſſe, or everlaſting life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This they reject. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 4. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Again, if you inquire, whether a man can do more good then he doth, or omit more evill then he omitteth; The <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Divines affirme he can, whether you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the unregenerate,<note place="margin">Act.

But without the grace of God he can do no ſuch thing; and he that ſaith the contrary, He is injurious to the grace of God on one ſide, and on the other ſide he falls into plain Pelagianiſme, as they ſay. Here obſerve, the queſtion is propounded by them concerning the Regenerate, one in a ſtate of Grace, and ſuppoſed to be under the influences of the divine aſſiſtance according to that ſtate, whether ſuch an one can do more good then he doth, or omit more evil then he omitteth. Now they do not anſwer directly and poſitively, that he can, but with this addition, <hi>By the Grace of God,</hi> he can do it; which is an inſinuation of the negative, that he cannot without a further meaſure of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116027:73"/> Grace ſuperadded, to that; wherein, being regenerated, He is uppoſed to ſtand, as was ſaid before.</p>

               <p>The Divines of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> do affirm, That <hi>there is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall promiſcuous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Evangelical founded in the merit of Christs death. De Art.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Belgick</hi> Profeſſors do affirm; That it is not denyed by the Orthodox, but to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Goſpel is preached, the Ranſome

               </p>
               <p>But all are not of this mind. For the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>

               <p>As concerning the new Covenant's being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht with every man; we anſwer, that whether God could do it or no, we will not diſpute: but that he would ſo eſtabliſh it, we deny.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame judgement are the Deputies of the Churches of <hi>Frieſland. Ibid.</hi> 130. And the whole Synod rejects it as an error in them that teach, That all men are received into the ſtate of reconciliation and grace of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo that no body ſhall be condemned for Originall ſin, nor, in reſpect of it, be liable to death or damnation, but that all are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted and freed from the guilt of that ſin. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Rej.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 253.</p>

                  <hi>Lubbertus</hi> ſaith, We do not teach, that God ſimply would not have all men to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſaved; neither do we teach that God feigneth, or would not ſeriouſly the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, or that he hath contradictory wills.

                  <hi>Sibrand Lubbertus,</hi> is for the Affirmative; as was now alleadged; and ſo are the Synod in their Decrees, where they ſay, That, as many as are called by the Goſpel, are called ſeriouſly. For God by his word doth ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and moſt truly declare, what is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, namely that thoſe that are called, come unto him: and moreover doth ſeriouſly promiſe to all ſuch, as come to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, reſt for their ſoules, and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Art.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Divines ſay, Thoſe whom God doth thus affect by his Spirit, uſing the means of his Word, thoſe he doth truly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly call and invite to faith and converſion. <hi>De.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Art.

Seeing therefore, that the Goſpel, according to its own nature, cals men to repentance and ſalvation, ſeeing the excitations of Divine grace tend the ſame way, we muſt conclude, that God doth nothing here feignedly. This is proved by thoſe ſerious and patheticall <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeechings.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. (19.) We beſeech you

               <p>But this Doctrine will not down with the Deputies of the Synod of <hi>Gelderland:</hi> we had their invincible <hi>Syllogiſmes</hi> before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Minors</hi> are theſe. 1. <hi>God calls not all men to ſalvation.</hi> 2. <hi>God doth not command every man to believe in Chriſt:</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt calls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the thirſty</hi> &amp;c. <hi>onely.</hi> But they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their mind more roundly, upon the <hi>third</hi> Article; For whereas the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> do argue, that theſe two things are very repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant, That God would have a man to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and yet ſhould not give him what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enable him to convert and believe, (without which ſalvation is not to be had.) To this they Reply, That it ſeems no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to them, that God ſhould call one to ſalvation, and yet not communicate ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. Whence we conclude (ſay they) Seeing God does not give to all that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which is neceſſary, that they might
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116027:76"/> convert and believe (and he could give it if he would), therefore he would not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſalvation unto all men, and therefore neither would he call unto ſalvation All, that are outwardly called: nay ſeeing God calls All to ſalvation, whom he calls; therefore as many as are not called unto ſalvation, are not called of God; that is to ſay, thoſe, to whom he will not give, what is neceſſary for them, that they may convert and believe. <hi>Et mox.</hi> And by this means we ſhall preſerve the Dignity of the (Divine) Calling. <hi>Act.

               <p>To this agrees the Declaration of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Deputies of <hi>Groningen;</hi> The ſound of Preaching doth promiſcuouſly reach the ears of all men: but in effect it calls them onely whom God hath elected to eternall life.

               </p>
               <p>There are ſome externall works ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of men, before they be brought to the ſtate of Regeneration or Converſion, which are wont ſometimes to be freely done,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116027:76"/> ſometimes freely to be omitted of them; as, to go to Church, to heare the Word, and ſuch like.

               <p>To the like purpoſe, do the Divines of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> deliver their Judgement, in this Point. 'Tis certain, they ſay, that ſome Acts of Sorrow, Contrition, Acknowledgement of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do precede Faith and Converſion in a man that is to be regenerated; whiles by the Miniſtery of the Law and Goſpel he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive Grace. <hi>Ibid. pag.</hi> 137. <hi>p.</hi> And ſo the Divines of <hi>Geneva;</hi> The ſalutary ſenſe and feeling of ſin, joyned with a thirſt after the remedy, a good hope, ſoftneſſe of heart, hatred of ſin, and flying unto God, theſe are latent effects of the holy Spirit, preparing and drawing a man by little and little to the grace of Juſtification, and unto Regeneration. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 155. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>But with the <hi>Haſſian</hi> Divines this is pure <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> or <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine; and therefore they reject this as Heterodox; <hi>That a man in the ſtate of ſin, before Faith and the Spirit of Renovation, hath, or may have any zeale, care or ſtudy, to obtain Salvation; and that he may heare God's word, be grieved for ſin, deſire ſaving grace, and the Spirit of Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that this is moſt profitable and moſt neceſſary to the obtaining of Faith and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Renovation, as the</hi> Remonſtrants <hi>do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly teach.</hi> Alſo, <hi>That a man in the ſtate of ſin, before his Regeneration and Vivification, hath the knowledge of his</hi> (ſpirituall) <hi>death, grief and ſorrow for it, deſire of deliverance, hunger and thirſt after life, likewiſe confeſſion of ſins, contrition, initiall fear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as our Brethren the</hi> Remonſtrants, <hi>ſpeak at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at the Hague.</hi> All this they reject. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 144. <hi>Reject.</hi> 6.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:116027:97"/> humble, and diſpoſed unto life eternall, <hi>as though in ſome ſort Election depended on theſe things.</hi> Is not here an inſinuation, as if the Remonſtrants held this Doctrine, (the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the Synod being to declare againſt them) yet ſay the Remonſtrants, this is falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by way of Calumny thrown upon them; for the Contrary appears as clear in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as the light at noon day<note n="a" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>72.</hi>
                  </note>. In the ſixth <hi>Rejection,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thoſe who teach <hi>that not all election unto ſalvation is unchangeable, but that ſome which are elected, the Decree of God notwithſtanding, may periſh and for ever do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> The Synod herein doth adulterate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and traduce the Doctrine of the Remonſtrants by odious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>76.</hi>
                  </note> That laſt branch, that <hi>the elect may periſh eternally, the Decree of God notwithſtanding,</hi> is without cauſe thrown upon them, and againſt their judgements. For the firſt, they ever profeſſe Election and the will of God to be <hi>immutable.</hi> Indeed when they ſay ſo, they make the ſubject, about which Election is exerciſed, to be the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> man, as <hi>ſuch.</hi> Hence it comes to paſſe, when that man who believes to day turnes Infidell to morrow, there is no change in Gods Election, but in the man onely. The Reaſon is, becauſe God will not chuſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116027:97"/> but the faithfull. And therefore when the faithfull man becomes unfaithfull, the will of God concerning the Election of faithfull men remains uniform and the ſame: But the truth is, if the will of God, or the Divine Election concerning that man, (now) become unfaithfull, ſhould perſevere, then the will of God ſhould properly be changed; becauſe he ſhould will to elect unto ſalvation not onely the faithfull men, but the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo.</p>
               <p>In the Seventh <hi>Rejection;</hi> the Remonſtrants complain, that <hi>they</hi> (of the Synod) have cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed a moſt certain truth with ſome rough invented Phraſes, to make it odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and look ugly.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>77.</hi>
                  </note> The Errour rejected is, <hi>That in this life there is no fruit, no ſenſe, no certainty of immutable election unto glory, but upon condition, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and mutable.</hi> But the Remonſtrants profeſſe they have not theſe words in all their writings. They know no fruit more ſweet to a pious man, then what grows upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods unchangeable love; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will moſt aſſuredly conferre eternall life upon believers. As for that opinion (which ſome place ſo much of their comfort in) that he who doth once truly believe, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies certain of his being in the faith and Grace of God, however he pollutes, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:116027:98"/> himſelfe, this is a fruit, which indeed they cannot reliſh, growing onely upon that tree of Election, which (by whomſoever it was planted) hath no ſound root in Scripture.</p>
               <p>In their Ninth <hi>Rejection</hi> the Synod doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly inſinuate (to make them odious) that the Remonſtrants teach, That <hi>the cauſe why God ſends the Goſpel rather unto this Nation than unto another, is not the meere and onely good pleaſure of God, but becauſe this Nation is better and more worthy of it than that, to which he hath not communicated the Goſpel.</hi> But the Remonſtrants know none that do ſay or think ſo. Upon all occaſions they have profeſt and taught the contrary, ſaith the Author of that <hi>Antidotum, pag.</hi> 79. <hi>v. ſqq.</hi>

               <p>Touching the Second Chapter <hi>(of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption)</hi> in their Second <hi>Rejection,</hi> (That <hi>this was not the end of Chriſts death, that he might eſtabliſh a new Covenant of grace by his blood; but onely that he might procure unto his Father the bare right of making again with men any covenant whatſoever, whether of Grace, or of works</hi>) here in the firſt member (of this Article) they impute to the Remonſtrants what is manifeſtly falſe, and contrary to their publick Doctrine. And the Second Member is a fiction and interpolation to render them odious. <hi>

               <p>In the Fourth <hi>Rejection,</hi> the firſt branch is of the ſame complexion; and the oppoſition made therein very unapt and ridiculous. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 89.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Rejection,</hi> the Remonſtrants obſerve to be equivocal, and to admit of a double ſenſe. Whereof they account one to be falſe, but the other they do moſt ſtedfaſtly embrace. <hi>ib. p.</hi> 90.</p>
               <p>Touching the Third and Fourth Chapters, <hi>(of Converſion)</hi> they ſay, they may juſtly challenge three things of the Synod. 1. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam fidem.</hi> 2. <hi>Charitatem ſive aequitatem.</hi> 3. <hi>Prudentiam &amp; attentionem, pag.</hi> 104. The firſt we are now concern'd to inquire into. And whereas, in their Firſt <hi>Rejection,</hi> they condemn the Remonſtrants, as teaching <hi>(that it cannot well be avouched that originall ſinne of it ſelf it ſufficient for the condemning of all mankind, &amp;c.)</hi> If they underſtand this of <hi>Adam's</hi> firſt ſinne, there is none of them but acknowledge, that the guilt of it hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread <hi>his</hi> whole poſterity, and made them obnoxious to condemnation: But whether that which is appendant to it, by way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, makes a new guilt and begets a new puniſhment, no act of mans will paſſing unto the eſpouſing of it; this they think too vain and triviall a ſubtilty to contend about.</p>
               <p>In their Fourth <hi>Rejection,</hi> They inſinuate, that the Remonſtrants teach, That <hi>an Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is not properly, nor totally dead in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116027:99"/> ſins, nor deſtitute of all ſtrength tending to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good, &amp;c.</hi> whereas there is not one of them that did ever write or affirm ſo: but in their third Article they confeſſe, That in the ſtate of Apoſtaſie and ſin, man of himſelf and by himſelf can neither <hi>think, will,</hi> or <hi>do</hi> any good, that is <hi>truly</hi> good.</p>
               <p>In the Seventh <hi>Rejection,</hi> They impute to them, that they teach, that, <hi>The Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are converted is nothing elſe, but a gentle ſuaſion, &amp;c.</hi> whereas there is not one of them have ſuch an affirmation, That nothing elſe is required to the power of believing but a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſuaſion. <hi>Quid enim ineptius quam Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam in homine effici per ſuaſionem?</hi> For what can be more fooliſh than to affirm that a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer may be wrought in man by perſuaſion?</p>
               <p>In the Eighth <hi>Rejection</hi> they charge them to affirm, <hi>That it lyeth in mans power to be, or not to be regenerated.</hi> When their meaning is no more but this, that it may come to paſſe, that man may oppoſe a new contumacie, or reſiſtance to God's Call, <hi>&amp;c. Ibid. pag.</hi> 105.</p>
               <p>In the Fifth Chapter <hi>(of Perſeverance)</hi> (as in the reſt) the 1, 2, 3, and 4 <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>119.</hi>
                  </note> are obſerved to be of the ſame argument and importance, that by the Fiction of a multiplicity of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours the Remonſtrants might be rendred the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116027:99"/> more odious; and this is none of the moſt conſcionable, much leſſe worthy dealing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is (to uſe Maſter <hi>Baxter's</hi> own words) a <hi>perverſe</hi> inſinuation in the firſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> where they affirm, there are ſome (meaning the Remonſtrants) who teach, That <hi>Perſeverance is a condition of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is to be performed on mans part, by his own free-will, before his peremptory election and juſtification.</hi> In that this condition is ſaid to be performed by mans <hi>free-will,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibib. p. <hi>126.</hi>
                  </note> the Remonſtrants are brought under a ſuſpicion, as if they did not think the grace of God and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit neceſſary unto perſeverance in that which is good; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Synod knew they were of a contrary perſuaſion: Beſides, by implying, that they ſhould aſſert any <hi>free-will</hi> to be in man, which was not made ſo by grace, to do that which is pleaſing unto God, they procured the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants envy, which was a manifeſt injury to them.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in the Second <hi>Rejection,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants are (Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> would ſay) feigned to teach, That <hi>when as all abilities neceſſary unto perſeverance, and all things, which God is pleaſed to uſe for the preſervation of faith, are granted and ſet in readineſſe, that it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the choiſe, and pleaſure of mans will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116027:100"/> to perſevere, or not.</hi> Which words do dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſinuate, as if the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants did believe and teach,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that God, for his part, doth firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all thoſe things, that are behoofull, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, and then leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, affording them no further grace or help to aſſiſt, and exſtimulate them to do their duty: But this is far from the Remonſtrants Doctrine, who did alwayes undoubtedly hold, that God doth alwayes, both in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, progreſſe and end, more eſpecially in temptations, aſſiſt and help man by his grace to perſevere in that which is good, unleſſe he confronts thoſe divine aides and ſuccours by the unworthineſſe of a ſhamefull neglect, or the oppoſition of a contumacious rebellion. The liberty whereof, under the moſt gracious and potent diſpenſations, is ordinarily, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His moſt juſt and wiſe providence, reſerved unto man by Almighty God, that ſo his perſeverance may be, under ſuch a ſweet conduct, a work of his own choiſe and duty, and conſequently capable of the Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and reward.</p>
               <p>Once more; That <hi>Author</hi> complains, that ſuch Doctrines are imputed to <hi>them,</hi> as the Remonſtrants, never ſo much as dreamt of, eſpecially, as they ſtand reported by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. For example; ſuch as are in their Fifth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116027:100"/> 
                  <hi>Rejection,</hi> viz. <hi>That no certainty of future per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance can be had in this life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>127.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>without ſpeciall revelation.</hi> Indeed they own no ſuch certainty of a future abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſeverance, as flows from an inconditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Election, and ſerves to furniſh Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for the ſecure and ſinfull, in the midſt of their perverſities, drowning their cares and ſorrows, and extinguiſhing their fears of hell fire and Gods diſpleaſure. But they do moſt willingly acknowledge that an upright man, one that feareth God, eſchews evill and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth righteouſneſſe, may be certain of his future perſeverance; ſo that no force, fraud, or fallacy ſhall be able to rob him of (that treaſure) his hope of eternall life, if ſo be he be not wanting to Gods grace, but walks cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly in that road which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to lead him in, and beſet it with Guards of Angels to ſecure his paſſage againſt the incurſions of the enemie. And he that walks according to this Rule, Peace be upon him and mercy! But in the Sixth <hi>Rejection,</hi> there is another unworthy imputation caſt upon the Remonſtrants, viz. <hi>That it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commendable thing to be doubtfull of future Perſeverance.</hi> They ſay, That as the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are begotten to a lively hope, ſo they go on (if they do their duty) to a Perſuaſion, and grow up to a full Aſſurance, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116027:101"/> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11. hort every one (with the Apoſtle) <hi>to ſhew the ſame diligence to the full aſſurance of hope even unto the end.</hi> And this is Goſpell truth, Chriſtian conſolation, and a practice laudable. But for the certainty of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, as was mentioned above; they do not onely doubt of it, but abſolutely deny it, as having no juſt Title to the ground 'tis built upon, and having a <hi>Genius</hi> that comports too much with the intereſts of the fleſh and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecurity, and apt to make abatements in our accounts of ſolid devotions, and the practice of Holy duties. He that ſeeks for ſuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his perſeverance in God's favour, as may be made ſerviceable to careſſe him in the heighth of his luſt and vanity, is ſure never to find it otherwiſe, then by <hi>ſpeciall revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For the Holy Scriptures will not afford it. And the <hi>Revelation</hi> that brings it being contrary to that Rule, how extraordinary ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, cannot come from heaven, and therefore ought to be ſuſpected (if ever it comes) for a ſtrong deluſion. And now having diſcharged my undertaking, and brought Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> to ſo full and cleare a view, of that <hi>unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable dealing, unworthy falſification,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe inſinuation,</hi> in the Practices of his own <hi>Party,</hi> I hope they ſhall receive equall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from him with <hi>Tilenus</hi> and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

And therefore though they have not the very words, they come not ſhort of the ſenſe. For they ſay, <hi>that out of the common maltitude of ſinners, he</hi> cull'd <hi>out to himſelf, for his own peculiar, ſome</hi> certain. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Art.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; Art.</hi> 7. <hi>A ſet number of certain men,</hi> and ſo <hi>Rejection</hi> 1. And <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>Art.</hi> 7. They ſay, <hi>Under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God diſcloſed unto but a</hi> Few <hi>this ſecret of his will, (viz.</hi> concerning ſalvation) and yet I hope it was diſcloſed to all the Elect (at that time in a capacity to receive the Revelation.) So that by luck, we have found, <hi>a Few,</hi> even in their Canons, and <hi>ſome certain, cull'd, out</hi> perſons, for his own <hi>peculiar.</hi> And now I hope
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116027:102"/> Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> will be ſatisfied in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, if I had in <hi>Tilenus</hi> his behalf ſaid, that the number whether more or leſſe ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the quarrell But the next word would have done it, if Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> had not been prudent in the choice of it; For he doth not rudely ſay, <hi>It is a lie,</hi> but more modeſtly, <hi>It's not true?</hi> But what is the untruth? That they ſay, he doth it (elect unto ſalvation) <hi>(Without any regard to their faith or obedience whatſoever.)</hi> But doth Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay this is an untruth? yes and proves it too, and that ſubſtantially, by a handſome way of ſliding from the queſtion; For <hi>they profeſſe,</hi> ſaith He, that <hi>he</hi> (God) <hi>hath regard to it,</hi> (and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble regard too), 1. <hi>as the benefit which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth to give them,</hi> 2. <hi>As the condition of the Glory, which he decreeth them.</hi> But what is this to the matter in queſtion? The queſtion is about the <hi>Previſion</hi> of it, as a <hi>qualification,</hi> wrought by Gods Grace, in the perſon <hi>to be</hi> Elected, and you tell us of a Proviſion made for it, that it may be wrought, <hi>ex Poſt facto,</hi> after they are elected. I'le diſcover the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency in a familiar inſtance. Suppoſe Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> hath a ſequeſtred Parſonage at his diſpoſall, and power to give <hi>Ordination, Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Induction:</hi> one reports of him that he hath made choice of an <hi>Incumbent</hi> without <hi>any regard to his Learning or Godlineſſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116027:103"/> whatſoever,</hi> he being acknowledged to be a very ignorant and vicious perſon to all the neighbourhood. Upon this report Maſter <hi>Baxter's</hi> Confident undertakes the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſalve the matter, He cryes out, <hi>It's not true,</hi> that he made him Incumbent to that Parſonage; without <hi>any regard</hi> to his <hi>learning or Godlineſſe</hi> whatſoever; For he had regard to it, 1. as a benefit, or quality which he deſigned to work in him. 2. As the condition of that greater preferment which he intended to confer upon him. This is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Baxters</hi> way of Anſwering <hi>Tilenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He decreeth to ſave none</hi> (ſaith M. <hi>Baxter) but for their Obedience as the fruit of faith, which is not a means or Antecedent to Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, but to our ſalvation, as the moſt rigid</hi> Anti-Arminians <hi>teach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(For obedience as the fruit of faith?) Is the fruit better then the tree? why not for Faith, as well as for obedience, or rather for both together? But if ye ſhould ſet it ſo (Faith being much dearer to ſome of them then Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience) yet I doubt many of your rigid Anti-Arminians would not teach ſo. Why not thus? <hi>By Grace</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:116027:105"/> to aggravate Relapſes into ſin. For they who doe fall from God, when he hath adorned them with <hi>Good</hi> works, as they do more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly ſin, ſo are they alſo more ſeverely puniſhed,<note place="margin">Loc.

Negative, That none ſhould aſſiſt or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their needs, 2. Poſitive, That they ſhall loſe their heads: but this ſhall be for neglect of duty, or diſobedience; which that they may be found guilty of, they are ſummon'd to appear in perſon, as becomes their Noble birth, and <hi>his</hi> Eminence, to fight his battails. Theſe unhappy perſons appear with ſuch ſtrength and Accoutrements as are left them,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116027:106"/> according to the notice they have of the Prince his pleaſure. But being unable, naked wretches as they are, to ſubdue their Princes enemies, He is informed, that now he hath a juſt cauſe to fall upon them, and take away their lives, and accordingly Sentence is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the fatal Block and Axe imploy'd for a preſent execution. If any ſhould complain, that this were great ſeverity, towards poore wretches made miſerable by their Fathers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, which they could no way hinder or conſent unto (being no way privy to it); Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is an able Advocate to juſtifie theſe proceedings. He will tell us, (if one ſhould ſay theſe men were appointed to death without any regard to their diſobedience) it was for their diſobedience and neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Prince <hi>decreed</hi> to behead them, as the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of their beheading, though not of the <hi>Decree</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Here it will be ſeaſonable to take notice of a ſubtile Diſtinction, which ſome of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes uſe of to maintain that <hi>(Horrible Decree)</hi> as Maſter <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> calls it,<note place="margin">Antid. p <hi>38.</hi>

What is the ground of this opinion or Diſtinction? When God condemneth the world, He performs the Office of a <hi>Judge,</hi> who pronounceth ſentence upon the <hi>guilty,</hi> and therefore he hath (in that Capacity) a reſpect to <hi>foregoing</hi> ſin, as the <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe of that his ſentence.

Hereupon he concluded, that <hi>no man is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated but for ſin. (ibid. parag.</hi> 3.)

But if <hi>Tilenus</hi> be of this opinion, <hi>What manner of Perſons ought we to be in all holy Converſation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11.</note> For it ſhould ſeem by this Doctrine, that a <hi>holy faith</hi> and a <hi>blameleſſe</hi> life, are made the previous diſpoſitions to our immutable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection unto Glory. But this will uſher in a new objection of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> againſt <hi>Tilenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>if he think,</hi> (ſaith Maſter <hi>Baxter) that God foreſaw that they would believe and obey, before he decreed to give them faith or the grace of obedience, and conſequently that theſe are onely or principally of themſelves, and not of God, be muſt condemn</hi> Auſtin <hi>&amp;c. as well as the Synod of</hi> Dort.</p>
               <p>Here we have a very <hi>Perverſe inſinuation,</hi> if I may make ſo bold, with Maſter <hi>Baxter's</hi> leave, to uſe his own expreſſion. <hi>Believe and obey</hi> (you mean the Goſpel) before a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116027:115"/> of it, or a call to it? Was <hi>Adam</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do ſo, or could he do ſo in his ſtate of Innocency? And will poore collapſed <hi>Tilenus</hi> pretend to it? No, he hath ſtudyed the Myſteries of Grace, and learnt himſelf, and the incapacities of Man-kind better. God hath, not onely a <hi>Foreſight,</hi> which is, as I may ſay, bounded within the compaſſe of things <hi>future,</hi> In their due time, <hi>exiſtent;</hi> which cannot be without <hi>his</hi> Decree: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Foreknowledge,</hi> which extends to all things <hi>Poſſible,</hi> though no Decree ever did, or ever ſhall paſſe for the futurition or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of them. Thus He foreknew that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up <hi>David</hi> into the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.12.</note> if he had ſtay'd amongſt them; and thus he foreknew that <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">

Now ſuppoſe, Almighty God to conſider men under ſuch a ſtate and order of means; though he hath not, as yet (to ſpeak after the manner of men) decreed to eſtabliſh either ſuch an order, or ſuch men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, yet by his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> he infallibly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowes what creatures of ſuch capacities, would do, being put into ſuch a Poſture. But for Faith and Obedience, theſe duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:116027:115"/> to ſome Authority and Revelation, and requiring power far above what remains in us ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> it implies a Contradiction to ſay, Man can believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Goſpel, before he receives as well a competent ſtrength as a proper Object for it. But Almighty God having put ſuch and ſuch capacities into us, and placed us under ſuch and ſuch means and diſpenſations, in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſdome, He Foreknowes what uſe and what improvement every one will (in that order) make of thoſe capacities and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; And then making a Decree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this his Foreknowledge, He Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees who will believe and obey, not before he <hi>decrees</hi> to give them Faith or the grace of Obedience, as M. <hi>Baxter perverſly inſinuateth:</hi> but <hi>after</hi> it, (though conſidering <hi>them</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch an order of means, he <hi>foreknew</hi> it, before his Decree) and conſequently this both <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> are neither <hi>onely,</hi> nor <hi>principally</hi> of <hi>themſelves,</hi> but of <hi>God;</hi> And this is conſonant to the Doctrine of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Church, for all the pureſt Ages of it.<note n="†" place="margin">As M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

But the truth is, men of your <hi>Ortho-DORT</hi> Perſuaſion, if they ſpeak conſonantly to <hi>Right</hi> Reaſon, they muſt conclude the prayers of the <hi>Major</hi> part of mankind, to be groſly <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall</hi> and abſurd. For according to your principles, ſome, even of thoſe, who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctified, (for ſuch S. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> by your own acknowledgement, allowes to be amongſt the <hi>Non-Elect</hi>) can never addreſſe themſelves to their Devotions, but they muſt, either pray for their own damnation; which is <hi>irrational;</hi> or that the Divine <hi>Decree</hi> about it (as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated by your Doctrine) may be repealed; which is no leſſe <hi>irrationall</hi> then the former. And in (that which is of generall Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the Uſe of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> (A <hi>Forme,</hi> which I hope M. <hi>Baxter's</hi> modeſty will yield to be as <hi>Rationall,</hi> as any his zeale, Phantaſie or Godlineſſe can make, at leaſt <hi>Ex tempore,</hi>) All the Non-Elect are, by unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, involved in offering up (as it were in one breath) croſſe Petitions to a like Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For, according to your Doctrine, All theſe Non-Elect, are left, at leaſt, in the <hi>Lapſe</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> under (as many call it) an <hi>efficacious</hi> Permiſſion to fall into <hi>Actuall</hi> ſin; in intuition and reſpect <hi>whereof,</hi> they are <hi>Predamned</hi> to everlaſting fire; and the <hi>End</hi> of this, you ſay, is the Advancement of

Hence it follows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, that in offering up thoſe Petitions <hi>[Hallowed by thy Name; Thy Kingdome come; Thy will be done;]</hi> They pray for their <hi>own</hi> damnation. And again, ſeeing this <hi>Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> (to which, <hi>Your's</hi> ſay, they are <hi>Preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> upon this account) is the greateſt <hi>evill</hi> of Puniſhment, (or a combination of them All,) To which, though they may be <hi>Decreed</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of many <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) by Gods <hi>Right</hi> of Dominion, or his <hi>abſolute</hi> Soveraign power of Juriſdiction, yet <hi>adjudged</hi> and ſentenced to it <hi>juſtly</hi> they cannot be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin; and therefore the ſaid <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious</hi> Permiſſion of ſin, and the perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Deniall</hi> of Grace <hi>Sufficient</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> (without <hi>which</hi> there is no Remiſſion) are Decreed likewiſe, as the unavoidable <hi>Means</hi> of bringing that <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi> Decree to its <hi>Finall, Infallible</hi> executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Hence it follows by unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, That in offering up thoſe other Petitions, <hi>[Forgive us our treſpaſſes; and lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evill,]</hi> Theſe <hi>Non-Elect</hi> do implicitely Pray, that the <hi>ſaid</hi> Decree may be <hi>Repealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his <hi>Queſtion</hi> following, <hi>[Would you not have men pray for faith that want it?]</hi> May
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:116027:117"/> put a man to a ſtand, if not to ſilence. The Synod it ſelf was not reſolved about it.

If this be true, to what end ſhould a man pray for faith that wants it?

But you obſerve God <hi>gives</hi> both to <hi>Believe and ſuffer;</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you mean the opportunity and patience to glorifie his Name and Goſpel by their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for ſure you cannot think that God did actually inflict the reproaches, which they ſuffered, or their ſtripes upon them; and if you underſtand it of the grace and power to yield ſubmiſſion to their Perſecutions with meekneſſe, we muſt remember the conceſſion till we meet with a fit occaſion to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>interim</hi> we will hare the patience to read out your long objection; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſtill in theſe words, [<hi>Sure you do not mean when you pray for</hi> [Increaſe of Faith] <hi>that God would give you naturall free-will, which you had before, or that he would ſend the Goſpel to you; but ſome way that he will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually procure you to believe.

               <p>To be a <hi>Helper,</hi> is a Title, which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty frequently takes upon himſelf; and

Nemo adjuvatur, ſi ab illo nihil agatur.</hi> If we ſtyle God our <hi>Helper,</hi> we ſuppoſe our ſelves to be in action, and our Prayers deſign'd to ſolicit his aſſiſtance, not to cut out work for him. If we think thoſe divine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, under whoſe influence, we deſire, in our prayers, to be conducted, ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all our good motions, we might ſoon be tempted to throw off all care and leave all other duties to be wrought in us, by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and betake our ſelves wholly unto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And having entertain'd this vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how many are there in the world, that, when they ſuffer infirmitie, or fall into fouler ſins, are ready to aſcribe it, not ſo much to their own neglect of duty (for alas! humble and modeſt wretches, they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!) as to the ſuſpenſion of that divine Omnipotent determination, that ſhould have accompliſhed the <hi>ſame</hi> in them.

               <p>Our <hi>torpor</hi> and lukewarmneſſe is a diſeaſe that wants ſo great a remedy as our own prayers and God's quickening aſſiſtance.

For ſuch is God's gracious Condeſcenſion, in his intercourſe with poore Sinners, that he makes <hi>Prayers</hi> to them too, that they would be converted, and be reconciled, and be at peace with him.

               </p>
               <p>And by Parity of Reaſon, your objection from <hi>Rationall</hi> Thankſgivings will admit of a like Solution.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain we can never give Almighty God ſufficient thanks for the Riches of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant grace and favour towards us. But there are a ſort of ſturdy Beggers, that will croſſe the proverb and be chooſers too; and if they may not have what they liſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main churliſh and unthankfull for all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our bounty. But the <hi>law</hi> hath made a good proviſion, in appointing not an almes to cheriſh, but a whip to chaſtiſe ſuch diſpoſitions. A <hi>[God I thank thee]</hi> may be expreſt with no little vehemency of Spirit, when men have little thanks for their labour; For 'tis ordinary, as well to aſcribe unto God what his Juſtice will not own,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.10.</note> as to expect what his wiſdome will not grant.<note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116027:123"/> doth vouchſafe commendations and <hi>praiſe</hi> to our well performed duties. Whatever the Ignorant vulgar do, a wiſe man will not caſt away his commendations upon the actions and combatings of thoſe little <hi>Puppets</hi> that play in fight, but reſerves them for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that inviſible hand behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by whoſe <hi>ſole</hi> ſtrength and activity they are put into their ſeverall poſtures. If our Regeneration or converſion be wrought in us <hi>ſolely</hi> by Gods Omnipotent ſtrength, <hi>without us</hi> (as the Synod hath deſigned) it were very abſurd that <hi>we</hi> ſhould have any praiſe for it: yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, that, <hi>that circumciſion of the heart, in the Spirit,</hi> (which can be nothing elſe but regeneration, or converſion) though it gains no <hi>praiſe</hi> from <hi>man,</hi> as not ſubject to his obſervation, yet it hath <hi>praiſe of God.</hi> Rom. 2. ult.

               <p>God underſtands the extent of his own work and his creatures duty, better then you or I; and he is ſo jealous of his own glory,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116027:124"/> he will not proſtitute any part of it to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy flattery of his Vaſſals. The Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Applauſe he gives them, at the end of the day, when their work is done, is an earneſt admonition unto us, who are ſtill upon duty in the Vineyard, that he expects to be honoured by an ingenuous and free obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To lay all the burden of our duty upon his operation, that the more thanks may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to him upon that account, is to grow lazy that Grace may abound; And he will never accept of ſuch thanks, as are ſet up to commute for duties that are attended with more coſt and difficulty, or are made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe for ſloath, or an incouragement to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would aske, from whence theſe <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> you ſet ſo much by, come? Sure, if the reſt of your good Motions carry this ſtamp of Divine and irreſiſtible Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination upon them, your <hi>Thankeſgivings</hi> do ſo too, and then whether they be <hi>Rationall</hi> or no, you cannot but perform them, and in that caſe, whether it be <hi>Rationall</hi> to expect praiſe and glory for them, I have ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be doubtfull. The ſumme of all is this; The Praiſe which God gives his ſervants for the performance of their duty, it is a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Praiſe, or it is not. I hope, you will not ſay the laſt, for ſhame; for admit there be a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:116027:124"/> great Grace in it, yet you muſt allow that there is ſome truth too,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17</note> and then it muſt be <hi>Rationall;</hi> for God is a God of wiſdome. If this praiſe be <hi>Rational,</hi> then it is for ſomething <hi>done</hi> that might have been omitted, or done otherwiſe; elſe how can a man <hi>have praiſe in himſelfe alone and not in another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>In ſhort, this puts the difference, betwixt that Good, that conſiſts in <hi>duty,</hi> and that which conſiſts in operations <hi>merely</hi> voluntary; and that whether they proceed from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> Perfection, as in God, or from the benefit of <hi>exalted</hi> Nature, as in Saints, and Angels. They, who are ſubject to a law in the quality of <hi>Probationers,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their <hi>triall</hi> for preferment, they can give no proof of themſelves; Acts of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection they may do, but rewardable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they cannot performe, unleſſe they have liberty of <hi>Contradiction</hi> (as the Schools call it) a freedome to do, or not to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is otherwiſe with Angels and holy Spirits at their journeys end, when they <hi>Reſt</hi> from their duties,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.</note> and reign as kings in the poſſeſſion of eternall bliſſe. The excellency of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:116027:125"/> conſiſts in a perfect voluntary Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the <hi>chief Good,</hi> with a full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acquieſcence in the fruition of it, with out that imperfection of a liberty to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Upon our arrival in heaven, and our immediate approximation unto God, when we ſhall be like him, and ſee him, as he is in Glory, we ſhall then <hi>Will</hi> Good as the bleſſed Saints and Angels do, moſt voluntarily, yet not of freedome but neceſſity: But to doe this, is the Prerogative of our Nature, in higheſt <hi>ſtate</hi> of Exaltation, by way of reward upon the conſummation of her <hi>duty,</hi> which is <hi>free</hi> obedience, and never properly performed (unleſſe by ſpeciall diſpenſation, if any ſuch be granted) but when we have it in our own power and choice to do otherwiſe. But this contemplation hath tranſported me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my bounds. All that is deſired of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is this, that he will allow, that praiſe, which the moſt wiſe God gives unto men for their good duties, may be as <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> as Man's Thankſgiving for the benefit of the Divine Grace; and then his objection will amount to nothing. But as long as he continues ſo eager in a palpation and flattery of his own Reaſon, He muſt expect to meet with ſome Adverſary, that will be no leſſe zealous in a juſt vindication of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But let us attend to the caſe he puts
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116027:125"/> for <hi>Tilenus</hi> to anſwer, which is uſhered in with a <hi>[If,]</hi> and an interrogatory, after this manner.</p>

               <p>He addeth another Reaſon (<hi>Parag.</hi> 10.) If God hath deſtined his creature to perdition, it is neceſſary that he ſhould have deſtinated it to ſin too, without which that perdition cannot be juſt, and ſo God ſhall be the impulſive cauſe of ſin. Nor can man be juſtly puniſhed for that ſin, unto which he is either preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtined, or compelled by the will of God. And (<hi>Parag.</hi> 6.) He flies higher, and ſaith, By this kind of Reprobation the Innocent creature is not onely made moſt miſerable, but alſo moſt wicked. For if God doth firſt

This Opinion therefore, even in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> (to whom the Synod gives ſo great commendations, amongſt their Acts<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>To give them</hi> (the Non-elect) <hi>the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power of free will, and a Chriſt to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in, and an offer of Chriſt and life, and an earneſt perſuaſion of them to accept him, and to leave the matter to their own choice, yea and to adde common exciting moving help of the Spirit, which yet is</hi> uneffectuall, <hi>this is it that the Jeſuits call ſufficient Grace.

               <p>But let us examine how much it weigheth, that the Non-elect may ſee how much they are beholding to him for his curteſie. A thing may be ſaid to be effectuall or uneffectuall in a twofold ſenſe; as for example, a medicine may be effectuall of its own nature, againſt ſuch a diſeaſe, and yet, prove uneffectuall through his fault to whom it is adminiſtred; and that either becauſe he will not indure the Application of it; or becauſe he will do ſomething or take ſomething, that prevents or diſturbs and interrupts the operation of it. But when Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us of his <hi>ſufficient uneffectuall</hi> Grace, he doth not take <hi>uneffectuall</hi> in this ſenſe. 'Tis uneffectuall in its <hi>kinde,</hi> and of its own nature (as to the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116027:135"/> production of faith and converſion, (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Doctrine) and not onely through the fault of him to whom it is adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>So that we may ſet forth the ſufficiency of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> Adminiſtrations, for cure of the ſin-ſick ſoule, by a compariſon of the like made to the body.

               <p>Let the Reader judge whether M. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould not deſerve a <hi>fee</hi> of ſuch a <hi>ſick</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for affording him ſuch a <hi>ſufficient</hi> means of Cure.

But that we may not doubt he is in earneſt, he renews his Grant in theſe words; <hi>This Generall and Common Grace which ſuch call ſufficient, leaving the matter to the ſinners choice, we yield that God giveth to the worſt that periſh. Which ſuch call ſufficient?</hi> Who are thoſe <hi>[ſuch]?</hi> Such as your <hi>ſelf,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> But the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants are <hi>Non-ſuch.</hi> If you go to the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its</hi> Schools to learn the doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants, no marvell you are deceived. But that the Reader may not follow you in your error, I muſt tell him the Remonſtrants have not ſo learned Chriſt, having been taught as the <hi>truth</hi> is in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I muſt not take leave of this paſſage,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:116027:136"/> till I have taken notice of a <hi>[perverſe inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion]</hi> in it, in theſe words, <hi>[Leaving the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ſinners choice].</hi> What, as if a man ſhould bring food, or Phyſick, or Cordials, to the door of a ſick Bed-rid perſon (under a pretence to releeve him) and <hi>leave</hi> it there (for him to take in, who is not able to ſtirre out of his bed) and depart, taking no further care for the importation of it? This is none of the Remonſtrants Doctrine. God doth not leave the matter to mans <hi>choice</hi> in this ſenſe. He continues his ſollicitations, till he hath been very frequently and very ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repulſed (<hi>for his Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, Gen.</hi> 6.) He ſtands at the doore (which is within our ſick-mans reach,<note place="margin">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:116027:136"/> chuſe the feare of the Lord.</hi> And this is good wholeſome Doctrine with Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> when he gets into the Pulpit; For there he tels his Congregation, in good ſober ſadneſſe, that the reaſon that moſt men periſh, for all the mercy that is in God, and for all that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered,<note place="margin">Treatiſe of Converſ. pag. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> and for all the Grace that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in the Goſpel, is, <hi>What? Even becauſe they will not receive this Grace, nor entertain Chriſt and the mercy of God, as it is offered to them.</hi> And what doth this ſignifie, but this, <hi>becauſe they would not chuſe it?</hi> And upon this account they are condemned, and very juſtly. Yet when he is come from his pulpit, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to diſpute with <hi>Tilenus,</hi> 'tis not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> and Chriſts <hi>Merits,</hi> and the Divine <hi>Grace</hi> be at his choice, to receive it; this may ſerve the Non-Elect: <hi>But be not angry,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if we thank God for more, even for giving us both to Will and Do.</hi> If you may be allowed to be your own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, no doubt, you will be very liberall in the choice of your own portions; and if God ratifies it, 'tis well for you. But we find that Gods deſign, in his way of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Grace, is to promote and advance duty: but your way doth evacuate and cancell it. For if he workes the very <hi>Act</hi> (which we
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:116027:137"/> call duty) by an irreſiſtible operation, <hi>in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſine nobis,</hi> as the Synod ſaith of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>in us but without us,</hi> then <hi>duty</hi> is no more <hi>duty,</hi> but <hi>neceſſity:</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> is no more <hi>Grace,</hi> but <hi>force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God worketh to <hi>Will</hi> and to <hi>Do,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acknowledge with no leſſe thankfullneſs then your ſelves, if you mean a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> in us to <hi>Will</hi> and to <hi>Do</hi> (as you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed your meaning to be, a little before, when you ſaid, He gives both to <hi>believe</hi> and to <hi>ſuffer</hi>) that is, a <hi>power</hi> to do it; yet ſo as the will is left, more <hi>free</hi> rather then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined under an irreſiſtible neceſſitation, and conſequently man may abuſe his liberty,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Beloved hearers; the office that God hath call'd us to, is by declaring the glory of his Grace, to help under Chriſt, to the ſaving of mens ſouls. I hope you think not that I come hither to day of any other Errand. The Lord knowes I had not ſet a foot out of doores, but in hope to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this work for your ſoules.

And then, 2. it would follow that God were the <hi>Firſt</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertor in reſpect of this <hi>new</hi> Covenant, which is againſt all ſober Divinity. 3. It will make the Covenant of Grace to be no leſſe intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than that of workes; for by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it doth exact <hi>impoſſible</hi> commands, and afford no ſtrength at all to perform them.

               <p>What ſhould move Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> to change his opinion in this Article? I will give you my conjecture.

And if the Redemption, wrought by Chriſt, be not ſuppoſed as a common benefit, beſtowed on all men: that indifferent and promiſcuous preaching of the Goſpel committed to the Apoſtles, to be performed among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould have no true foundation, as <hi>Martinius</hi> hath obſerved. What ſhould theſe men do in this caſe,<note place="margin">De Artic. <hi>2.</hi> Theſ. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> or what ſhould they ſay? To ſay, the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel are not to be Preached to all, the more <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> dare not. To ſay, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> are Promiſes of the Goſpell, is to confeſſe them to belong <hi>indifferently</hi> and promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the Reprobate, as well as to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; and then maintaining that <hi>theſe</hi> are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed moſt <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> to be wrought <hi>in us, without us,</hi> by God himſelf; this would by an undenyable conſequence intitle the Non-elect

               <p>The other <hi>Promiſes</hi> (in <hi>their</hi> diviſion) are concerning the <hi>Means, Faith, Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> which are <hi>abſolute,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to be wrought of Almighty God <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us,</hi> by the <hi>ſtrength of his Omnipotency,</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> are the <hi>Propriety,</hi> and <hi>Free-hold</hi> of the Elect; not to be <hi>indifferently</hi> and promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preached.

Perhaps (to give him the Title, he beſtowes on <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi>) our <hi>Oculatiſſimus Baxterus,</hi> upon his <hi>ſecond</hi> thoughts, diſcovered this foule <hi>Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;</hi> and to prevent <hi>it,</hi> choſe rather to call them <hi>Revelations</hi> concerning the infallible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> than <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> But there is another <hi>foul</hi> Abſurdity ſticks even to <hi>his</hi> Doctrine, and he cannot poſſibly ſhake it off, that is, He makes Chriſt to be ſet up as a <hi>Double</hi> Saviour; For unto <hi>ſome,</hi> he hath procured <hi>ſanctifying</hi> Grace, which he doth effectually and irreſiſtibly communicate, to redeem them from ſin and their vain converſation, and this in order to their Glory; And thus <hi>he</hi> is the Saviour of the <hi>Elect.</hi> But for others <hi>he</hi> allows no more, but <hi>externall</hi> Miniſteries, with <hi>Common</hi> Grace, which is <hi>uneffectuall,</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> in order to their condemnation too; ſuch a Saviour <hi>he</hi> is to the Reprobate; Indeed in reſpect to <hi>theſe,</hi> he is made a Pure <hi>Socinian</hi>-Saviour; from whom (according to this Doctrine) they receive little or no influences, but thoſe of his Holy <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>A Grand Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar.</hi>

               <p>And yet, right or wrong, Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> now he is ingaged will purſue his <hi>vindication,</hi> as he imagineth, to a perfect Triumph; and therefore he pleads moreover for the Synod, that <hi>they adde,</hi> That <hi>[the Reaſon why many that are called by the Goſpell do not repent or believe, but periſh in Infidelity, is not through any defect of the Sacrifice of Christ offered on the Croſſe, or inſufficiency of it, but by their own fault.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By their own fault?</hi> Saith the Synod ſo? Alas! how could that be? It was a <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> indeed inflicted on them, when as yet they had but a mere <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of <hi>Being</hi> in regard of the ſufficiency of the Divine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to effect it. So the <hi>Creabilitarians,</hi> or <hi>Gomariſts</hi> have determined. But to come as low, as the loweſt <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> Admit it were upon the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam;</hi> yet <hi>he</hi> could not by <hi>that</hi> Fall, forfeit an <hi>intereſt</hi> in Chriſt, which he never had <hi>before</hi> that Fall (for then, that being a <hi>means</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to <hi>riſe</hi> again <hi>after</hi> falling, <hi>he</hi> could not have loſt it, by falling) whether for <hi>himſelf,</hi> or his <hi>Poſterity.</hi>

If you ſay, that according to you Christ hath purchaſed Grace for all, or for more then the Elect, to Cauſe them to believe.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I. <hi>That the higheſt Grace with you doth but bring it to their choice; and help, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their wills; and this</hi> (but not verily this) <hi>they grant to others, as well as you do.</hi> 2. <hi>Is it the</hi> Name <hi>of</hi> ſufficient <hi>Grace, or the</hi> Thing? <hi>The thing that you call ſo, as I ſaid</hi> (too often already, unleſſe it had been to more purpoſe), <hi>they grant to be as common as you can Reaſonably expect them to imagine,</hi> (you ſay right, conſidering the reſt of their Principles,) <hi>and Chriſt did not die to purchaſe empty Names, as a benefit.</hi> (I pray, what is that <hi>Remiſſon</hi> of ſins, and <hi>eternall life,</hi> which you ſay he purchaſed for Reprobates? Is there <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi> too? They heare the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:116027:162"/> ſound of it, but never any of them taſted how ſweet it is.) <hi>The difference</hi> (you conclude) <hi>is plainly but in this: The Synod thought that Chriſt purchaſed more for ſome, then you do; but no leſſe for others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> in <hi>extreams;</hi> he is exceſſive in his bounty towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, but defective in his Charity towards the Reprobates; and therefore no wonder he is out in the <hi>mean,</hi> which is that Grace that brings Salvation to Man's <hi>choice,</hi> as ſtated (not by <hi>him</hi> but) by the Remonſtrants.</p>
               <p>For the Firſt, he is <hi>deficient</hi> even in his Pretended <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> and the Accompts being truly and exactly caſt up, we ſhall find the Reprobates are very little obliged to him, or to the Synod, for their <hi>Alms</hi> of ſufficient Grace.</p>
               <p>For when they ſpeak of <hi>Grace,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand either Gods <hi>Love</hi> and favour; or the effects of it. Gods Grace in the firſt ſenſe is, either <hi>Generall,</hi> extended to all mankind conſidered, as Rationall Creatures, but out of Chriſt, and this, though the Reprobates have an intereſt in it, will not ſerve the turne; or <hi>Speciall,</hi> which paſſeth into a Decree of Election, and thereby provides Chriſt and all other means neceſſary to the working of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and bringing Salvation (as they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm) inſuperably. And this is a peculiar
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:116027:163"/> 
                  <hi>Incloſure</hi> to the Elect. If we take Grace in the Second ſenſe, for the effects of Gods free Love and favour; this Grace is divided (as the former) into <hi>Generall</hi> and <hi>Speciall;</hi> The Speciall Grace which is ſaving, is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to the Heirs of Salvation, ſaith M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and the Synod too, that is to the <hi>Elect.</hi> The Generall, is that <hi>Common</hi> Grace, conſiſting of ſuch effects as flow from Gods <hi>Generall</hi> Love, and this is vouchſafed to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Which Grace, though adorned with the Title of <hi>Sufficient,</hi> to tickle the fancy of the unwary vulgar, and flatter him into an apprehenſion, that it containes all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto his ſalvation, yet really it ſignifies onely (in the very acknowledgement of the more ingenuous ſort of <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) ſo much as is ſufficient to <hi>Convince</hi> men of their ſinne and miſery, of their infirmity and want of a Redeemer; and becauſe it <hi>informs</hi> them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that Chriſt is <hi>ſuch</hi> an one, ſent to give <hi>life</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> upon condition of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> (though <hi>intentionally</hi> deſigned for the benefit <hi>onely</hi> of the Elect) and <hi>that</hi> life and pardon is tender'd to them upon <hi>thoſe</hi> conditions, which are <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>thoſe</hi> Elect, but made <hi>impoſsible</hi> to <hi>the</hi> Reprobate; therefore by the adminiſtration of this <hi>Common</hi> Grace, <hi>they</hi> become guilty of <hi>impenitency</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> and ſo <hi>this</hi> Grace
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:116027:163"/> is <hi>inſervient</hi> to the execution of the <hi>Decree</hi> of Reprobation; And this is all the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> I can find in it, whether I examine it by <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Table,</hi> or the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Synod.</p>
               <p>We ſee how little the Reprobates are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you for your bounty. For this your <hi>ſufficient</hi> Grace, both <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing,</hi> is of no more value then a <hi>New Nothing,</hi> which many times is promiſed unto children to pleaſe them; but with an intent really to couſen them; and therefore diſcovering the fallacy, we account it a piece of ingenuity in them to ſlight the offer.</p>
               <p>If the Non-elect neither have, nor can have intereſt in that Grace of God (by what name ſoever you will call it) which is of force to procure Converſion and a ſaving faith, what do you telling them of the reſt, by which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man was, nor ever ſhall be, nor ever can be ſaved? And is it poſſible for any man to arrive at Salvation, who lies under the Decree of <hi>Preterition,</hi> and is thereby, <hi>ipſo facto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Now I Conjure every Chriſtian Reader, as he tenders the Glory of our ever Bleſſed God, and the Honour of his moſt Holy Ordinances, and the eternall Salvation of mens precious ſouls, ſadly to weigh and conſider, the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influences of ſuch a Doctrine; that his underſtanding may be awakened to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and his will inclined to entertain, more ſolid practicall principles of Divinity; that every mouth that utters ſuch wickedneſſe, may be ſtopped.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as your Doctrine <hi>brings</hi> not the <hi>ſame</hi> Thing to their choice; ſo neither doth it bring the <hi>ſame</hi> aſſiſtance.

Why Sirs, if the Lord ſhall ſay to us at Judgement, Did you never tell theſe men, what Chriſt did for their ſoules, and what need they had of him, and how nearly it did concern them to look to their ſalvation, that they made light of it? We muſt needs ſay the Truth: Yea Lord, we told them of it as plainly as we could; we would have gone on our knees to them, if we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:116027:173"/> had thought it would have prevailed; we did intreat them as earneſtly as we could, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things: They heard of theſe things every day; but alas, we could never get them to their hearts: they gave us the hearing, but they made light of all that we could ſay to them.</hi> And in the <hi>Preface</hi> of your <hi>Call to the UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONVERTED,</hi> you tell them, <hi>Our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and Perſuaſion, and your Hearing and Conſidering, are the appointed means to get this Morall Power or freedome,</hi> that is, <hi>to make you truely willing.</hi> You know <hi>theſe</hi> have no other way of operation, but, what is <hi>Morall,</hi> which may be rejected or embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and therefore if there be not a <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> power ſufficient <hi>(in actu primo)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon men, with a <hi>liberty</hi> to reduce it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>act,</hi> which they may <hi>freely</hi> uſe or <hi>ſuſpend,</hi> to what end are all theſe exprobrations of their neglect?

               <p>You go on; <hi>The Queſtion is,</hi> Whether men have Originall ſin or not? <hi>Thoſe of you that are of Doctor</hi> Jeremy Taylor's <hi>minde in this, ſpeak out, and diſown the</hi> Pelagians <hi>no more, but ſpeak as bitterly of</hi> Auſtin <hi>as of the Synod of</hi> Dort. To which I anſwer, 1. That men have <hi>originall</hi> ſinne; the <hi>remote</hi> Cauſe whereof is Gods <hi>imputation</hi> of it: but the <hi>next</hi> Cauſe is their <hi>Carnall Generation.</hi> For the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is therefore of <hi>right</hi> imputed to us, becauſe we are <hi>carnally</hi> propagated from <hi>him,</hi> now become <hi>guilty:</hi> and ſo according to the fleſh <hi>we</hi> were as a certain <hi>part</hi> of him <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> becauſe we then exiſted in <hi>his</hi> loines, when he ſinned. The like, in a manner, is ſaid of <hi>Levi</hi> paying tithes in the loines of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Heb. 7.9, 10. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> then, is not <hi>whether men have originall ſin</hi> derived to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:116027:192"/> them from <hi>Adam,</hi> for that is yielded: but whether being <hi>called,</hi> they have a <hi>new power</hi> given them by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to become <hi>Evangelically</hi> Righteous? and this queſtion M. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtated with ſome ſhew of moderation in his firſt <hi>Aſſize</hi> Sermon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 12, 13.</note> and reſolved it ſeemingly according to the ſenſe and meaning of <hi>Tilenus.</hi> His words are theſe; <q rend="inline"> [The laſt Queſtion is, Who they be that are and may be urged to glorifie God on this ground, that he hath bought them? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, onely thoſe whom he hath bought: but who are thoſe? It diſcourageth me to tell you, becauſe among the godly it is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; but if they will controvert points of ſuch great moment, they cannot diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige or excuſe us from preaching them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the variety of mens opinions, it is ſafe to ſpeak in the language of the holy Ghoſt, and accordingly to believe, viz. that, <hi>As by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to condemnation even ſo by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi> Rom. 5.18. And <hi>that he gave himſelf a ranſome for all, and is the onely Mediator between God and man.</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5, 6. That <hi>he is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2. That God <hi>is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:116027:192"/> believe.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10. That <hi>he is the Saviour of the world.</hi> Joh. 4.42. 1 Joh. 4.14, 15 <hi>That he taſted death for every man.</hi>
                  </q> From which cleare evidence Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that he doth acknowledge a <hi>Generall</hi> Grace in words, though indeed, in the reſult, as he defines it, it is not ſo much <hi>Grace</hi> as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,</hi> having no power to ſave, and being deſigned onely to render the perſons, upon whom it is conferred, inexcuſable, and their damnation the more intollerable. But <hi>Tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> farre more to the advancement of Gods <hi>Grace</hi> and Chriſts merits, doth conclude from thoſe <hi>Texts,</hi> by him alledged, That God for Chriſts ſake doth conferre upon <hi>all</hi> thoſe, who are <hi>called</hi> by the Goſpel, a <hi>new power,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are inabled, if they uſe their diligent endeavour, and be not wanting to themſelves and that divine Grace, to expedite and free themſelves from the <hi>ſervitude</hi> of ſin. But by what conſequence this ſhould be drawn to prove a denyall of <hi>Originall</hi> ſin, I am not able to imagine, ſeeing this <hi>Sufficient power</hi> all men will not make uſe of, no not ſo much as to exempt and free themſelves from that <hi>ſervitude</hi> of ſin, which is ſuperadded to ſin <hi>Originall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Doctor <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> you ſhould do well to ſtop his mouth firſt (not by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and unworthy inſinuations, but by ſolid

               <p>Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> runs on in <hi>perverſe Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:116027:200"/> ſtill, ſaying; 2. <hi>[If you think that God doth not cauſe Faith in us, you will not then pray for it, nor be beholden for it.]</hi> I am ſo well aſſured that it is God that cauſeth Faith in us, (in the ſenſe of Holy Scripture) that I account my ſelf obliged, not onely to pray for the working and increaſe of it, but moſt humbly and heartily to thank and bleſſe him alſo for the Poſſeſſion and benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> then ſaith Maſter <hi>Baxter, If you yield that he cauſeth it, but not by ſuch a power as you mention, you either think that God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it without power (which is an opinion that needs no cenſure) or that he hath many Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and cauſeth one thing by one power, and another thing by another: which is as unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Divine or Chriſtian to aſſert.</hi> Anſw. 'Tis acknowledged that God cauſeth Faith, and that by his Power, which Power of his is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Omnipotencie, <hi>eſſentially;</hi> but exerted and put forth to the production of ſeverall effects, not like the Powers of Naturall Agents, which Act <hi>Ad Ultimum ſui Poſſe,</hi> to their utmoſt ſtrength, but in ſuch a Proportion and Meaſure, as ſeems meet to his All-wiſe Good pleaſure, to allow every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in order to its operation. For it is a certain Rule; <hi>Licet non poſſimus Deo tribuere virtutem agendi Lmitatam, nil tamen vetat, quod influxus extrinſecus ab eo ortus, non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineat
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:116027:200"/> omnem perfectionem poſſibilem in ratione influxus.</hi> Though God be omnipotent, yet every influx of God is not omnipotent, for what is <hi>Omnipotent</hi> is <hi>Infinite,</hi> and what is <hi>Infinite</hi> can neither be increaſed nor dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. If therefore every <hi>influx</hi> of God unto <hi>Second</hi> Cauſes were Omnipotent or Infinite, no one Influx of the Divine Power could be more ſtrong or forcible than another. But let us hear Maſter <hi>Baxters Probleme</hi> upon the point in theſe next words; <hi>[Is not all the world of ſober Chriſtians agreed, that</hi> Omnis Potentia Dei eſt Omnipotentia? <hi>Either God Cauſeth faith by the ſame Omnipotency by which he created the world, or elſe he cauſeth it not at all: For he hath no power but one, and that is Omnipotency.]</hi> Here Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtraines his wits to palliate the Synods abſurd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. To which end he confounds Gods <hi>eſſentiall</hi> Power, which is Omnipotencie, with the <hi>Egreſſions</hi> of the ſame Power to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> effects and purpoſes, which, as was proved even now, are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſſe</hi> powerfull, as the wiſdome of God is pleaſed to ſend them forth. But let us try what uſe we can make of this <hi>captious</hi> way of arguing; and I ſhall inferre from this Poſition of M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> one of theſe two Concluſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either, 1. <hi>That there is no Sufficient Grace given to the Non-Elect,</hi> which is againſt M. <hi>Baxters</hi> Doctrine;
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:116027:201"/> or 2. that <hi>thoſe Non-elect can conquer Gods Omnipotencie; which</hi> (to uſe his words) <hi>is as unbeſeeming a Divine or Chriſtian to aſſert.</hi> Thus I argue;</p>

                  <item>Therefore, to the Converſion of the Non-elect is exerted ſome Omnipotencie.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Now Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> may take his choice of theſe two Concluſions. If he ſaith there is no power of God exerted towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Non-elect; then his ſufficient Grace is vaniſht; for I preſume he will not ſay <hi>that</hi> is ſufficient to an effect, which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:116027:201"/> hath nothing of Gods <hi>power</hi> in it. But if he ſaith the <hi>Omnipotency</hi> of God is exerted towards their Converſion; then ſeeing they are not <hi>[de Facto]</hi> actually Converted, it will follow, that they can inſuperably reſiſt, and prevaile againſt Omnipotencie; which (to take no advantage) of the blaſphemy of that aſſertion) if they can do, though they ſhall be the greateſt <hi>Rebels</hi> in the world, they will deſerve to weare the crown for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding proweſſe.</p>
               <p>This will awaken Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> to the uſe of ſome of his <hi>Five</hi> ſenſes, which, to make a <hi>ſhow</hi> and fill up the Muſter, rather than for any great ſervice in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, are diſplayed in theſe words; <hi>[In theſe ſeverall ſenſes it may be ſaid, that a thing is the effect of Omnipotencie.</hi> 1. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſtrictly as denominating the cauſe. And ſo all that God doth is the effect of Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, even the life of a Fly; and therefore you cannot deny it of Grace:]</hi> This I ſhall not Queſtion. But 2. <hi>Improperly, as meaning that the Agent doth Act to the utmoſt of his Power, and could do no more: and thus never did any Divine that was well in his wits ſay, that Grace is the effect of Gods Omnipotency.</hi> 3. <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly alſo as meaning that ſo much power as was put forth in cauſing Faith, would have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a world; had it been that way imployed.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:116027:202"/> And this cannot be their meaning, becauſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Divines do not uſe to aſcribe ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greees of Power (unleſſe</hi> [which is a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for you] <hi>denominatively</hi> ab effectis) <hi>to God: and if they did, yet would they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to judge of the Scantling, and ſay, This work hath more power, and this leſſe: eſpecially in ſuch Myſterious works:]</hi> Anſw. 1.

'Tis too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that many of <hi>their</hi> Followers are not, which is the faireſt excuſe that can be made for many of their Doctrines and Practices.

Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ſlips away from the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not about the <hi>Object</hi> of Gods Will, but about the <hi>Influx</hi> of his Power; For 'tis not the <hi>will</hi> of God <hi>Reduplicativè,</hi> or <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenùs</hi> Will, that cauſeth the <hi>Thing</hi> willed, but <hi>quatenùs Potentia,</hi> as it is <hi>Power,</hi> as well as <hi>Will.</hi> And we muſt not forget to take notice, that <hi>Things</hi> willed of Almighty God, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willed <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> as his <hi>own</hi> workes, or <hi>disjunctively</hi> and <hi>conditionally,</hi> as Mans <hi>duty;</hi> Gods will <hi>alone</hi> is ſufficient to cauſe the things willed in the firſt ſenſe, but not in the latter; And this, not becauſe the Will of God <hi>alone</hi> cannot, (at leaſt if it doth not imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to ſay, God can do that which is <hi>Formally</hi> our Duty) but becauſe <hi>alone,</hi> it will not.</p>
               <p>But it is time to feel the pulſe of Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> fourth ſenſe, which beateth thus, [4. <hi>Improperly, as onely deſcribing the degree of excellency in the effects, as related to the Cauſe. As if they ſaid, there is ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in this effect of Grace, that no Cauſe below Omnipotency, that is, below God himſelf, could procure it.

               <p>But ſaith Maſter <hi>Baxter [They deny them no power but Morall, which is the willingneſſe

               </p>
               <p>We may ſay of the <hi>Devils,</hi> as much as you do here ſay of the <hi>Reprobates;</hi> we know they have <hi>a Paſſive Obediential,</hi> and alſo a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Active Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty</hi> of willing, and ſo farre can <hi>Accept</hi> (Grace).

To what <hi>end</hi> is it adminiſtred then? I am ſure many, if not all the <hi>Synodiſts,</hi> doe tell us, that it is to make them <hi>inexcuſable;</hi> by which Doctrine, God ſhould deale more hardly by <hi>theſe</hi> men then by the very <hi>Devils</hi> (as was ſaid above) to whom as the <hi>benefit</hi> is in no ſenſe tendred, ſo the <hi>unavoidable</hi> refuſal of it, doth in no

               </p>
               <p>But I muſt return to take notice what a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull <hi>Put-off</hi> Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is fain to make uſe of, to ſave the Reputation of his own, and the Synods Doctrine. We will illuſtrate it by this Similitude. Suppoſe a School to which are ſent many children; There is an <hi>Uſher</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to read a part of a <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Author to all theſe Children every day: and the head-Maſter culls out a ſmall number, to whom he privately communicates the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> and way of <hi>Parſing,</hi> and inculcates it with ſo much earneſtneſſe and affiduity that the meaneſt capacity amongſt them cannot but underſtand it; the reſt, which are much the <hi>major</hi> Part, are <hi>paſt-by</hi> and neglected, no care at all taken for their ſolid inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When notice is taken, and complaint made of this <hi>incongruous</hi> and <hi>partiall</hi> way of Inſtruction, according to the method where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thoſe few <hi>peculiar</hi> Favourites cannot <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,</hi> the <hi>reſt</hi> not <hi>receive</hi> the benefit, and therefore had as good abſent themſelves from the School: An Impertinent perſon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the <hi>vindication</hi> of this School and the Maſter of it, telling the Complainant, <q rend="inline">

Juſt thus doth Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> here; The Queſtion is (not about the <hi>Habit</hi> of faith or <hi>Morall</hi> diſpoſition to believe, as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> ſuggeſteth a little after, but) about <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Sufficient</hi> Grace for the <hi>begetting</hi> or <hi>acquiring</hi> that <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall</hi> Habit, or <hi>Spirituall</hi> Diſpoſition. The Synod ſaith, God doth ſo diſpenſe this Grace, that the Elect <hi>cannot</hi> reject it, but the Reprobates <hi>cannot</hi> accept it. No ſaith Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> there is no reaſon to object this againſt them; for <hi>they</hi> knew well enough the Reprobates <hi>[have a Paſſive and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiall Power, and alſo a Naturall Active Power or Faculty of willing, and ſo far can Accept.]</hi> What a piece of <hi>Sophistrie</hi> is here! a mere <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi> M. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſets himſelf quite beſides the cuſhion; And it would make one wonder to obſerve, that men, who handling other points of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:116027:208"/> make ſome ſhew of Learning and skill in the Arts and Sciences, when they come to diſpute theſe Controverſies, ſhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſuch evaſions and <hi>fallacies,</hi> and are content to ſerve themſelves of theſe mean ſhifts, rather than abandon their beloved er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith M. <hi>Baxter, [The Queſtion is onely of the Moral Diſpoſition: And I pray you, if you are a Chriſtian</hi> (which is more ſure, than that you are charitable) <hi>or a man of Obſervation, tell us, Whether you think that an Infidell hath a Habit of Faith, or a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of believing; or whether a drunkard hath a Habit or Diſpoſition of Sobriety, or a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger of Chaſtity, or a worldling of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe].</hi> I think not. But give us leave to ask you another Queſtion; Whether an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> Infidel, drunkard, whoremonger, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, have the <hi>Habits</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of Faith, Sobriety, Chaſtity, Heavenlineſſe? Yet <hi>theſe</hi> can and do <hi>accept</hi> (rather cannot refuſe) Grace, the reſt <hi>cannot</hi> accept it. Is the <hi>Paſſive</hi> and <hi>Obedientiall</hi> power, and the <hi>Naturall Active</hi> Faculty alone ſufficient hereunto in <hi>thoſe</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? No certainly there is ſomething elſe required. Therefore the Queſtion is not <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of the <hi>Morall Diſpoſition,</hi> as you ſay; for betwixt the <hi>Naturall Active Faculty,</hi> and the <hi>Morall power</hi> which you call <hi>Habituall

Never was the body of ſin vanquiſht, nor the ſoule of any one <hi>ſingle</hi> Chriſtian crowned under the <hi>conduct</hi> of it. And therefore perhaps you
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:116027:210"/> thought, you were as good to leave the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to their <hi>Naturall Active</hi> Facultie without <hi>that</hi> Aſſiſtance; which though they may <hi>Accept</hi> of, yet they cannot <hi>improve</hi> to their ſalvation: It is of <hi>another</hi> ſort, and deſign'd to <hi>another</hi> end, a means (not to <hi>ſave,</hi> but) to <hi>harden</hi> and render <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> for accompliſhing the <hi>Decree</hi> of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>But let us hear Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> appeal, which he enters in theſe following words; [<hi>Now I dare appeal,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to any Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, whether theſe vicious perſons have holy inclinations to the contrary vertue?</hi> that is, <hi>whether a wicked man be Habitually or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitively a Godly man?

               <p>In his next (which is the 14.) Section, Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> runs on in his wonted ſtrain of accuſation; for he tell <hi>Tilenus, [You wrong them alſo</hi> (and 'tis juſt ſo, and no otherwiſe then formerly) <hi>in feigning them ſimply to ſay, that</hi> thoſe to whom God gives grace cannot reject it.] It were a ſtrange <hi>Fiction</hi> I confeſs to affirm, that <hi>they ſay</hi> ſimply, when tis ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident they ſpeak ſo <hi>doubly</hi> and <hi>equivocally</hi> upon all occaſions.

If he underſtands <hi>Latine</hi> he will finde the charge <hi>Tilenus</hi> brings againſt them, acknowledged in the next words, which tels us, [<hi>They ſay indeed that,</hi> Poſt Dei operatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, (quoad ipſum) non manet in hominis poteſtate regenerari vel non regenerari, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] What alters the caſe? is it Maſter <hi>Baxters</hi> (for 'tis none of <hi>Tilenus</hi>'s) Dictum ſimplicitèr, or the Synod's, <hi>Secundùm quid,</hi> or, <hi>quoad ipſum,</hi> the firſt of which is a mere <hi>blinde,</hi> and the other ſuch an inſignificant <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis</hi> that the Engliſh Tranſlator thought
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:116027:212"/> fit to leave it quite out in his Tranſlation of thoſe Decrees. It is a notable ſign men are aſhamed of their opinions when they uſe ſuch figg-leaf diſtinctions to cover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But it ſeems <hi>[quoad ipſum]</hi> would not do it; and therefore Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> makes it <hi>quoad ipſam,</hi> in his Deſcant upon the words, or the Reaſon he renders to excuſe them; which is this that followeth, [<hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when effectuall Grace hath done its work, the man is regenerate already, or elſe grace were not effectuall:</hi> (do you give it that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>ab eventu</hi> then?)

               <p>But, hark you, Maſter <hi>Baxter,</hi> one word more before we leave this point. Are you ſure that ſuch <hi>odious</hi> inferences will <hi>fall</hi> upon <hi>our</hi> Doctrine, upon the Conceſſion of Gods <hi>Foreknowledge,</hi> as falls upon yours, upon the Poſition of <hi>ſuch</hi> Decrees? Why, according to <hi>your</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Decrees,</hi> things are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>future,</hi> becauſe they are decreed: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>ours</hi> of <hi>Foreknowledge,</hi> things are therefore <hi>foreknown,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>future.

And <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith, the Rebellion of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate depends upon the <hi>Antecedent, Abſolute,</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly Efficacious</hi> will of God; This <hi>Immutable</hi> Decree with that <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> means<note n="†" place="margin">Which are inſeparably tyed together.

                  <hi>Now, by ſuch enormous ſin, they greatly offend God, incurre the guilt of death, grieve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, break off the exerciſe of faith, moſt grievouſly wound the conſcience, now and then, for a time loſe the ſenſe of Grace;</hi> Yet <hi>Art.</hi> 6. they ſay, That <hi>God who is rich in mercy, according to the unchangeable purpoſe of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth not wholly take away his holy Spirit from</hi> (them), <hi>no not in their grievous ſlips, nor ſuffer them to wander ſo far, as to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the grace of Adoption, and ſtate of juſtification.</hi> And <hi>Art.</hi> 8. <hi>By Gods free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they obtain thus much, that they neither to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally fall from Faith and Grace, nor continue to the end in their falls, and periſh.</hi> Is not this the ſame Doctrine that <hi>Tilenus</hi> charge them with, to a very tittle?

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:116027:225"/> is upon deſign, when men uſe ſuch Artifice, to lead honeſt Paſſengers out of the right way.

               <p>But to make the <hi>impertinency</hi> of that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>[Quoad ipſos]</hi> more evident, I ſhall give you an illuſtration of it in this example.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:116027:225"/> made on purpoſe to ſupport him, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Would you not think this a very impertinent and ridiculous diſtinction, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a ſerious Queſtion touching a man's (eſpecially if it were eternall) ſafety?

               <p>Beſides, the Synod in thoſe their <hi>Decrees,</hi> where they thought it moſt <hi>plauſible,</hi> to <hi>fix</hi> Predeſtination upon the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> they confeſſe God did not reprobate the moſt part of the world without <hi>all</hi> reſpect of ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuppoſe all mankind <hi>infected</hi> with that <hi>corruption</hi> and ſtain of <hi>Originall</hi> ſin, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>with Adam,</hi> and God cannot but behold it, becauſe nothing is concealed from his eye: but they never confeſſe that God had reſpect to ſin as the <hi>impulſive</hi> or <hi>Meritorious</hi> cauſe, for which he did reprobate and ordain any to the torments of hell.

               <p>But ſuppoſe the Synod did grant (as their very nice and wary diſtinction, <hi>[abſque omni ullius Peccati reſpectu]</hi> makes it more than Probable, they did not) that God in mans Reprobation had ſome <hi>reſpect</hi> to his <hi>Actuall Perſonall</hi> ſin, yet if <hi>that</hi> ſin be ſuch as <hi>thoſe</hi> Reprobates could not poſſibly avoid, the whole matter will be reduced at laſt, to the <hi>reſpect</hi> of that <hi>onely</hi> ſinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> And

If we liſt to cavill about the word <hi>[Cauſe;]</hi> (which is here made uſe of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:116027:240"/> to impoſe upon the unwary Reader,) we could tell them, that 'tis an improper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ept expreſsion, to ſay Election is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Faith; For Election in an <hi>immanent</hi> Act in the minde of God, not an <hi>Egreſſion</hi> out of him, that produceth any effect in man, though Faith doth infallibly follow that Act, by the <hi>emanation</hi> of another power, which God, according to the Decree of Election, will exerciſe, to the irreſiſtible production of Faith. And thus it is acknowledged by <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> that, although the Decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation be not <hi>effective,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the Reprobate, becauſe it doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly effect or produce that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; yet it is <hi>efficax</hi> efficacious,<note place="margin">Antidot. p. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe that Decree being made, infidelity follows of neceſsity, For example. Suppoſe a man <hi>blind</hi> by nature, or <hi>made</hi> blinde by the infliction of puniſhment upon him for ſome crime; He that commands <hi>ſuch</hi> a man upon pain of death to <hi>read</hi> a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though to ſpeak properly he cannot be ſaid to be the <hi>cauſe,</hi> that that man reades not the Proclamation; for his <hi>blindneſſe</hi> is the <hi>next</hi> and proper cauſe hereof; yet in ſenſe of <hi>Law,</hi> and to ſpeak <hi>Morally,</hi> he may be ſaid to be the Cauſe, that by <hi>not reading,</hi> that blinde man becomes defective, as it were, in a duty injoyn'd him and ſo guilty of death;
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:116027:241"/> not by way of efficiencie, as producing the defect of reading in him, but by commanding that Reading to whom it is impoſſible to read, in whom therefore after that command, the defect of Reading cannot but follow. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, according to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, God deals by the Reprobates: firſt for the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with blindeneſſe of minde in things ſpirituall; ſo that 'tis no leſſe impoſſible for them to believe, when God commands it, than for a blind man to read a proclamation. And yet notwithſtanding they are thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſpirituall blindneſſe, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to believe under pain of eternall death. Which when God doth, he doth not, indeed, by way of efficiency produce infidelity and impenitency in them, but by his command God is the Cauſe, or brings it to paſſe, that they become as it were unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and impenitent; becauſe it is impoſſible, on the one part, that they ſhould become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, unleſſe the command of Faith doth intervene, and on the other part, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Faith being given, they cannot, in regard of that innate pravitie and blindneſſe, but be and remain unbelievers. And this is the means, which (for all their <hi>Profeſt dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi>) is tied to the End, (by the Decree of Reprobation) in order to the execution
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:116027:241"/> of the ſaid Decree, by the Damnation of the Reprobates.</p>
               <p>Another Doctrine, which, ſaith M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> the Synod doth <hi>purpoſely diſown, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe to deteſt</hi> is, <hi>[That many harmleſſe Infants of Believers are ſnatch't from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers breaſts, and tyrannically caſt into Hell, ſo that neither Baptiſme, nor the Churches prayers in Baptiſme can profit them.]</hi> That many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers are caſt into Hell, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Prayers of the Church, and the Sacrament of Baptiſm adminiſtred, (according to Chriſts inſtitution and command) for their Salvation, is the expreſſe Doctrine of <hi>Calvin, Beza, Zuinglius, Martyr, Zanchy, Piſcator, Paraeus, Perkins, &amp;c.</hi> For the Infants of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, it is the Doctrine of <hi>Gomarus</hi> and the Divines of <hi>Drent,</hi> expreſly, that they are Reprobates.<note place="margin">Act.

Another <hi>Fallacy</hi> is in the word <hi>[Tyrannicè] tyrannically,</hi> caſt into Hell: For when God doth Reprobate ſuch Infants, and caſt them into Hell, he doth not do it, they ſay, after the manner of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> who is bound by ſome certain Law, the tranſgreſſion whereof is <hi>Tyranny:</hi> but he doth it <hi>jure dominii,</hi> as an <hi>Abſolute</hi> Lord, whoſe Soveraignty is without Law or controll, and therefore he may diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure. That this is their ſenſe (notwithſtanding what they publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:116027:242"/> to deteſt) may eaſily be collected, from the 18. <hi>Art.</hi> of the 1. <hi>Chap. (Of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation)</hi> where to ſtop the mouthes (as they pretend) of ſuch as <hi>murmur</hi> at the grace of <hi>free</hi> Election, and <hi>ſeverity</hi> of <hi>juſt</hi> Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as they call it) they alleage that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 9.20. <hi>O man who art thou, that replyeſt againſt God?</hi> And that of our Saviour, Mat. 10.15. <hi>Is it not Lawfull for me to do what I will with my own?</hi> Texts of Scripture which the <hi>Creabilitarian-Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians,</hi> as well as the <hi>Exiſtentialiſts</hi> make uſe of for proof of <hi>their</hi> Decrees; and they are juſt as much to <hi>their</hi> purpoſe, that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>impertinent</hi> to the uſe thoſe ſeverall <hi>Parties</hi> do make of them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe Doctrines which the Synod doth <hi>purpoſely diſown, and publickly profeſſe to deteſt,</hi> there is another, which I wonder Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> hath omitted; which is this, [<hi>That this Doctrine of the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>maketh God the Author of ſin</hi>] But perhaps he hath ſmelt out the <hi>Fallacy</hi> expreſt in the Fifth Article of the firſt Chapter; where they ſay, <hi>Incrodulitatis iſtius, ut &amp; omnium aliorum peccatorum, cauſa ſeu culpa neutiquam eſt in Deo, ſed in homine.</hi> The cauſe or <hi>fault</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as of all other ſins, is in no wiſe, in God, but in man. Here are two words made uſe of, as of the ſame importance, <hi>[Cauſa
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:116027:243"/> ſeu culpa] Cauſe or fault,</hi> by which, while many of their Doctors do affirme that God doth <hi>incite</hi> and <hi>irritate, urge</hi> and <hi>impell, nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate</hi> and <hi>conſtraine</hi> men to ſin, nay, worketh ſin in them; yet ſhall they be excuſed from prevaricating the Doctrine of the Synod; for though to ſpeak properly God be the cauſe of ſin, by ſuch manner of working to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it, yet <hi>Culpa</hi> the fault of ſin can in no wiſe be aſcribed to him. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Keckerman</hi> have given the Reaſon of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no <hi>law</hi> made to <hi>bind</hi> Almighty God to the contrary, but man onely: For confirmation hereof they adde: <hi>Sicut Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus cum nunc has, nanc illas vaceas promiſcua &amp; vaga</hi> Venere <hi>init, adulterii culpa non te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur, ſed homo, ſi cum aliorum uxoribus rem habeat, eo quod huic, non illi, prohibens lex la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta fit; ita Deus peccato ſeu culpa non tenetur, cum creaturam ad hos &amp; illos actus movet, ſed tantummodo creatura ipſa, quia ei lex prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens lata eſt, non Deo.</hi> I ſhall not ſo much as Engliſh it for ſhame.</p>

This is no great temptation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite a peaceable ſpirit, to interpoſe in any of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:116027:254"/> your Diſputes. Yet finding that M. <hi>Pierce</hi> growes weary (upon ſuch like conſiderations) of drawing this Saw of contention (and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame him, having had ſo much harſh and jarring noiſe about his ears, as is more than enough to ſet any ingenuous perſons teeth on edge) and reſolving hereupon to give himſelf a little truce and reſpite, till he meets with further provocation; And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you alſo (I hope unfaignedly) profeſſing, that <hi>you are truely and heartily willing of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That according to the courſe of Gods ordinary diſpenſations, Chriſtians are not made <hi>Per ſaltum:</hi> (I ſpeak of the <hi>Adult,</hi> and perſons arrived to capacity) I conceive, a man, notwithſtanding thoſe <hi>habites</hi> of grace pretended to be infuſed at that inſtant, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſound <hi>Habituall</hi> Chriſtian at his firſt Converſion. My reaſon is, becauſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:116027:254"/> is a profeſſion and a matter of choiſe upon a mature and ſober deliberation, as our Saviour Chriſt hath taught us in that two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Parable. S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28. &amp;c. <hi>For which of you intending to build a tower, ſitteth not down firſt,</hi>

                     <hi>and counteth the coſt, whether he hath ſufficient to finiſh it? leſt haply after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it begin to mock him, ſaying, This man begun to build, and was not able to finiſh. Or what King going to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt, and conſulteth whether he be able, with ten thouſand, to meet him that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand? Or elſe while the other is yet a great way off, he ſendeth an embaſſage, and deſireth conditions of peace.</hi> Thus is the <hi>Diſcipleſhip</hi> of Chriſt to be entertained upon a deliberate, due and full account taken of all the coſt toil, and difficulties, which we muſt be at, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with in the profeſſion of it.

                     <hi>operans</hi> and not <hi>cooperans.</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> is brought in, in favour of this interpretation, where he ſaith, <hi>Ut velimus Deus ſine nobis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratur, cùm autem volumus, &amp; ſic volumus ut faciamus, nobiſcum cooperatur.</hi> To this purpoſe he produceth that place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 Cor. 15. <hi>Yet not I, but the Grace of God with me.</hi> For when he had ſaid, neither the Grace of God alone, nor <hi>Paul</hi> alone, he added: but the Grace of God wrought with him; that he was called from heaven, and that he was converted by ſo great and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a call, this was the Grace of God alone. To the like purpoſe <hi>Thomas</hi> is produced. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe authorities and the miſunderſtanding of this doctrine ſome have been drawn into an opinion, that <hi>in effectu gratiae operantis</hi> our will doth <hi>nihil agere, nec ſeipſam omnino mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,</hi> but is Paſſive and moved onely. But ſaith <hi>Eſtius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sent. d.</hi> 26. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.</note> this ſenſe is falſe and erroneous, and that he proves by three reaſons. 1. Becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act which that working Grace produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in us; as for example, to love God, to hate ſin, it is an Act of the will; not onely as of the ſubject, but alſo and chiefly, as of the eff ctive Principle: therefore the will in reſpect of that act, is moving, and not onely moved. 2. Becauſe that act, by which the will begins to will good, is a free act; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:116027:256"/> in reſpect of that act, the will is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving principle, not of any ſort, but a free one. 3. Becauſe Acts of this kind are under precept. For man is commanded to believe, to convert himſelf to God, to fly from ſin; therefore they proceed from the will freely moving it ſelf hereunto. Wherefore reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that falſe interpretation of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he concludes, their meaning was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this; That God works the firſt act or good motion of the will in us, by his grace, without any other motion of the will, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious in us, whereby we indeavour, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to that firſt motion, or whereby the will commands it: becauſe many times a good affection of the will is inſpired into a man, when he is very repugnant to it, as it happened in <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9. By this we ſee, that even in the opinion of thoſe men, that maintain, that way of <hi>efficacious Grace,</hi> by <hi>Phyſicall operation</hi> (as they call it) our rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Chriſtianity, or which is all one, our Converſion to the Faith, (even in the firſt act of it) muſt be a matter of free choiſe at leaſt. And as it is a matter of choiſe, to imbrace it at the firſt, ſo it is a matter of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and induſtrie to maintain it afterwards in conteſting to mortifie and ſubdue all thoſe corruptions, infirmities and temptations, which make oppoſition to the power of that
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:116027:257"/> profeſſion, which is the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>He that ſtriveth for the maſterie is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in all things: Watch and pray that ye fall not into temptation: Fight the good fight of faith:</hi> and <hi>be faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee a crown of life:</hi> and a multitude of ſuch expreſſions. 2. Whether, after long and faithfull ſervice, God may not vouchſafe, of his eſpeciall grace and favour, to reward the devotions and pains of ſome pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with a ſecure eſtabliſhment in a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table eſtate of <hi>indefectibility,</hi> this you know, the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> had no mind to diſpute. <hi>An verò non aliquando pro abſoluto jure ſuo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaria quadam ratione Deus fideles quoſdam,</hi>

                  <p>Before I proceed further, I could wiſh you would ſeriouſly conſider the importance of that caution given by the Apoſtle, Heb. 12.15, 16. <hi>Looking diligently leſt any man fail</hi> (or fall from) <hi>the grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſſe ſpringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled, leſt there be any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator or profane perſon, as Eſau, who for one morſell of meat ſold his birth-right, for ye know how that afterward, when he would have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the bleſſing, he was rejected.</hi> If you think ſuch caveats and threatnings, being applyed as preſervations againſt defection, do alwaies

                  <p>But to return to <hi>David;</hi> I think it very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to conclude him in an unjuſtified eſtate, out of your own principles. In your <hi>Account of Perſeverance,</hi>

For that he was guilty of a groſſe known ſin, you cannot, you will not deny; but where were his renewed reſolutions againſt it? where was the uſe of Gods means, or the reſtleſſe importunity of his ſoul to be delivered from it? Did he not give up himſelf to it, and induſtriouſly make proviſion for it, and live in it? Nay did he not upon deſign and contrivance, againſt all the ingagements of nobleneſſe, ingenuity, (and humanitie) proceed from one wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to nother? It cannot with any colour be denied. There is but one <hi>Salvo</hi> in all your three propoſitions to help you; you will ſay, perhaps, that <hi>in regard of the habituated ſtate of his will,</hi> he had rather have been rid of it, then have kept it. That does not appear, but very much againſt it. If it had been ſo, why did he not conſult his Prophet, or faſt and mourne, as he did afterward for the ſickneſſe of his child? His <hi>habituated eſtate,</hi> it ſeems, was a very ſecure ſtate, that the accuſtomed
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:116027:261"/> miniſtery of the Church would not ſerve the turn, but God was faln to diſcharge an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall piece of his Ordnance to awaken him out of it. You adde in your 10. Propoſition; <hi>That ſin doth as naturally breed troubles and feares, as the ſetting of the Sun cauſeth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or as a groſſe ſubſtance in the Sunſhine cauſeth a ſhadow. And this from the nature of the thing, and by the will of God.</hi> If it be ſo, what can we conclude, from the want of ſuch feares and troubles in him, but that 'tis probable, God left him for the time under ſome degrees of obduration?</p>
                  <p>And indeed, not ſo much the palpitation and trembling of the heart, through fears and troubles, as the hardning, of it, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion of <hi>preſumptuous</hi> ſinning. The Devill carries himſelf with a kind of baſhfulneſſe till he finds incouragement. And that man muſt be luſtily ſteeld with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that will be preſumptuous where he hath little intereſt. It is argument enough that the ſinne hath gotten a great force in a man when it is preſumptuous. Upon this account it is, that our <hi>Criminall</hi> prayes ſo earneſtly at another time, Pſal. 19.14. <hi>Keep back thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſins, leſt they get the dominion over me.</hi> Upon which words <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">In Pſal. <hi>19.</hi>

And it is true <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> as they are, and whileſt they are Gods ſervants. But if they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſervice of another Maſter, his luſts then they will do. Shall a man need to ſerve an <hi>Apprentiſhip</hi> to the trade of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can merit the title of being a <hi>ſervant</hi> to it? <hi>His ſervants ye are to whom ye obey,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Suppoſe <hi>David</hi> had onely been ſurprized at firſt, with the beauty of the woman (though indeed, thoſe ſins, whoſe horrid enormity is ſo great, that the very light of nature commands us alwaies to be in arms, and ſtand upon our guard againſt them, can never be excuſed or extenuated upon the account of a ſurprizall.) But put caſe I ſay, he had been ſurprized at firſt, yet upon whoſe command was it, 1. That (after ſufficient time of recollection and adviſement, when he ſhould have been at prayers) he ſent Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and ſure ſome preface of courtſhip was uſed to flatter and ſeduce her, and ſo took her and lay with her.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</note> 2. That he afterwards ſent for her husband, from his duty in the Leaguer. 3. That he adviſed him ſo earneſtly to go home and waſh his feet — and ſent a meſſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:116027:262"/> of meat after him. 4. That he blamed him under a pretence of pity, that he went not down to his houſe. 5. That he bad him tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till the morrow, and then invited him to an entertainment, where he made him drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. 6. That he laid ſo cunning a plot to murder him (whom he had ſo lately debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that he was ſcarce awakened, or at leaſt ſcarce recovered out of his diſtemper) and then wrote a letter, with ſo much formality, to <hi>Joab,</hi> to acquaint him, how he ſhould manage and carry on this projected ſtratagem, and laſtly, that he ſent it by <hi>Uriah's</hi> own loyall hand, making him carry the Warrant for his own unworthy and treacherous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; At whoſe command, I ſay, did <hi>David</hi> do all this? Was it not at the command of Luſt? and then, did he not obey her, as her ſervant? What clearer evidence can there be in the world then this, to prove, that ſinne hath got the Dominion over a man?</p>
                  <p>I'le offer you but one argument more, from the doctrine of Saint <hi>John.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17. verſes. Take it in this form, No man that is not of God, that hath not eternall life, nor the love of God abiding in him, but is of the Devil, and abideth in death, no ſuch man is in the ſtate of juſtification: But <hi>David,</hi> guilty of the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> is ſuch a man, <hi>viz.</hi> not of God, not having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:116027:262"/> life, not the love of God abiding in him, but is of the Devil, and abideth in death: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable, being the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of <hi>S. John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved out of the ſame Apoſtle. He that committeth ſin, and doth not righteouſneſſe, that loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him, that not onely hates, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually murders him, (like <hi>Cain</hi> for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his luſt) he is not of God, hath not eternall life, nor the love of God abiding in him, but is of the Devill, and abideth in death: But <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>Uriah</hi> committeth ſin, doth not righteouſneſſe, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not his brother, ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, and actually mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is again the expreſſe words of <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p>I am the more confirmed in the certain truth of this doctrine, by reflecting upon the ſcope and method of the Apoſtles diſcourſe upon it. Having repreſented the great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Adoption, he proceeds to declare that this priviledge is to be preſerved by a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſoul and life, ſuitable to that ſtate;

               </p>
               <p>Whoſoever may be <hi>certain</hi> of his eternal <hi>election</hi> and final <hi>perſeverance,</hi> may be certain of his ſalvation.</p>
               <p>A man guilty of groſs ſin, <hi>v. g.</hi> an adulterer or prejur'd perſon, without an actual repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his ſin, may be certain of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal election and final perſeverance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>A man guilty of groſs ſin, <hi>v. g.</hi> an adulterer or perjur'd perſon, without actual repentance may be certain of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident of it ſelf; becauſe <hi>election</hi> and <hi>perſeverance</hi> do contain all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved thus,</p>
               <p>Whoſoever after his unfeigned converſion, and ſome good progreſs in holineſs, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of groſs ſin, as adultery, &amp;c.

A man after his unfeigned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion &amp; ſome good progreſs in holineſs may become guilty of groſs ſin, as adultery, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore, a man guilty of groſs ſin, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, &amp;c. without an actual repentance
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:116027:290"/> of that ſin, may be certain of his eternal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and final perſeverance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident by the examples of <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others of the lapſed Saints.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved thus,</p>
               <p>Whoſoever may have <hi>examined</hi> the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his converſion and holineſs, and may remember, the <hi>reſult</hi> of that examination to be a <hi>certainty</hi> of his eternal election and final perſeverance he, though he becomes guilty of groſs ſin, as adultery, may without an actual repentance, be certain of his eternal election and final perſeverance. A man though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes guilty of groſs ſin, as adultery, may have examined the ſincerity of his converſion and holineſs, and may remember the reſult of that examination, to be a certainty of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal election and final perſeverance. Therefore without an actual repentance he may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is manifeſt; becauſe election, and perſeverance (ſuppoſed to be the fruit and effect of it,) are ſaid to be <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;</hi> therefore, he that is <hi>once</hi> certain is <hi>for ever</hi> certain of them; not only <hi>certitudine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti;</hi> but <hi>certitudine ſubjecti.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable; becauſe this <hi>examination</hi> of his ſtate, and the <hi>certainty</hi> which follows it, being, ſaid, to be <hi>poſſible,</hi> and his <hi>duty;</hi> A man that is <hi>unfeignedly</hi> converted, and hath made ſome
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:116027:291"/> good <hi>progreſs</hi> in holineſs, is preſumed to have performed it. Let me illuſtrate this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable truth by an example. Suppoſe a Prince makes a Decree that every perſon, who is liſted under his Command, and ingageth himſelf in fight, againſt the common enemy; ſhall be a <hi>Penſioner</hi> to him during life: he that knows himſelf to have been inliſted, and to have fought againſt the enemy, though he be for the preſent a captive in the power of the enemies hands, yet, ſuppoſing that Prince, to have an abſolute, inſuperable, and irreſiſtible power, and will to execute his ſaid Decree, (as the <hi>Synod</hi> hath determined in our caſe) he may (if he were ſure of life, as men are of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) aſſure himſelf, to be that Prince his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, with as great a confidence, as if he had never been taken captive. By this you may ſee upon what foundation the <hi>Antinomians</hi> build their judgement, [mentioned by you,<note place="margin">Pa. <hi>12.</hi> p.</note> in the ninth opinion, of the Saints Perſeverance] that <hi>though a believer fall into adultery and murder with</hi> David, <hi>or into Incest and drunkenneſs with</hi> Lot, <hi>he ought not to fear the loſs of his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor to be humbled with ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor to riſe from the ſin with ſuch a motive.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> And though you think this opinion ſo <hi>groſs,</hi> you need ſay no more of it then <hi>diſclaim</hi> it; yet, it
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:116027:291"/> had become a wiſe <hi>Maſter builder,</hi> much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to have razed the foundation, of ſuch an edifice, as gives harbour to ſuch <hi>monſters</hi> of opinion, and to have plucked up the <hi>roots</hi> of ſuch a <hi>peſtiferous</hi> weed; which, I have ſome reaſon to believe, you had ſo full and fair a view of in the <hi>decyphering</hi> of thoſe opinions. For the ſhort is; A man may be <hi>certain</hi> of his <hi>immutable election</hi> and <hi>final perſeverance,</hi> or he may not. If he may not; then (in the opinion of the <hi>Synodists</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Jud. Theol. ext. <hi>216.</hi> aph. <hi>9.</hi> &amp; p. <hi>223.</hi> th. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>249.</hi> q. <hi>9.</hi> Jud. Theol. prov. p. <hi>243.</hi> th. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>276.</hi> theſ. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note>) the foundation of firm and ſolid conſolation is blown up. If he may; (as they unanimouſly, and ſtrictly maintain) then he may be ſo ſtill, after he be fallen (as he may be) into the moſt groſs and horrid ſins imaginable; as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved above. From hence I ſhall draw another argument to prove this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to be <hi>a Doctrine not according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi> which is formed thus.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine, which takes away (from ſome ſort of men, under the guilt of groſs ſins) all fear of Gods diſpleaſure, of hell fire, and of judgement to come, that is a Doctrine not according to Godlineſs. This Doctrine (which the <hi>Synod</hi> maintains) that a man may be abſolutely certain of his immutable electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and final perſeverance, takes away, from
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:116027:292"/> ſome ſort of men under the guilt of groſs ſins, all fear of Gods diſpleaſure, of hell fire, and of judgement to come. Therefore this Doctrine is not according to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved; becauſe the holy Scriptures do ſo frequently inculcate this fear of God, hell and judgement, as a preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt defection and a ſpur to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith: but if any man draw, back my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved by what went before; and the undeniable conſequence of the <hi>Synods</hi> Doctrine. <hi>Qui ſio Electi ſunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Toſſanus, penitùs rejici &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeri nunquam poſſunt, tum quia ex decreto Dei certo &amp; immutabili eliguntur, tum quia non poſſunt non ſemper diligi in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto</hi>

M. <hi>Baxter</hi> had notice of this argument (though he does not apply it to one, that lies under the guilt of groſs ſin as he might,) for he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thus;<note place="margin">Of the S.

                  <hi>That which is impoſſible (or certainly not future) need not, and ought not, and if known to be ſuch, cannot be the object of rational fear, and care to eſcape it.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>the anſwer that ſatisfieth me, is this: that it's true that a known impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or non-futurity of evil doth evacuate rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal fear: But then he that will be perfectly freed from that fear, must have a perfect knowledge of the impoſsibility, or non-futurity. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles knew that thoſe, whom they wrote to, had no ſuch perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>
                  <pb n="504" facs="tcp:116027:293"/> (It ſeems all the Divines of the <hi>Synod</hi> had, however they came by it, and herein M. <hi>Baxter</hi> diſſents from them; for he ſaith farther,) <hi>Nay more, it is not (at leaſt by any ordinary means) to be expected in this life, that this knowledge of our ſincerity, Juſtification, and perſeverance ſhould be ſo perfect as to have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of doubting, habitual or actual.</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous confeſſion! And, ſuch is the force of truth,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> it hath drawn a further acknowledgement from him in theſe words; <hi>Moreover, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that carnal ſecurity, not onely in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, but in the godly themſelves, may poſsibly, and too frequently take advantage for increaſe, from the Doctrine of Perſeverance.</hi> In conſideration whereof he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes afterward,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This, proceeding from ſo cleer, and full a conviction of the danger that inſeparably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends thoſe Doctrines, I cannot but wonder what ſhould induce M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his judgement, to diſpute ſo earneſtly againſt the oppoſite <hi>Tenents;</hi> and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a manifeſt <hi>interfering</hi> in the procedure of his diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>14.</hi>

               <p>Your next <hi>thoughts,</hi> (which I ſhall reflect upon in this 20.

If when you ſpeak of a <hi>particular Act,</hi> there be no <hi>equivocation</hi> in the word <hi>[particular];</hi> As when <hi>David</hi> is taxed for <hi>the matter of Uriah,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> for his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full denying of Chriſt; if you take theſe for <hi>Particular Acts</hi> (wherein notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there was ſuch a complication of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued enormities) you may as well take a
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:116027:300"/> 
                  <hi>Sedition</hi> or <hi>Rebellion</hi> carried on with violence and bloud for ſeverall years together for a <hi>particular Act.</hi> 2. If the laſt <hi>Scene</hi> of a mans life, be ſo ſhut up that it begets no prejudice againſt ſuch a predominant eſtimation &amp;c. For <hi>if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. And <hi>if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> Hebr. 10.38. <hi>In his treſpaſſe that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die.</hi> Ezek. 18.24. And <hi>if the tree falleth toward the South or toward the North, in the place where the tree falleth, there it ſhall be.</hi> Eccleſ. 11.3.3. That one <hi>ſingle Act</hi> of groſſe ſin doth ſet a man further <hi>back,</hi> then a ſingle Act of the contrary <hi>virtue</hi> can ſet him <hi>forward;</hi> becauſe though the good cannot deſerve hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the bad do demerit hell; and (2.) though <hi>one</hi> ſingle Act be not the <hi>performing,</hi> yet <hi>one</hi> may be the <hi>violating</hi> that Covenant, which doth oblige us <hi>to ſerve God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of our life.</hi> Luk. 1.</p>
               <p>It follows in that 20. Section, <hi>That men thus Habituated, never live in a courſe of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſin:</hi>— and <hi>the ungodly have never one true act of ſaving love to God.</hi> This is true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplicativè</hi>

                  <hi>For</hi> Selimus <hi>to attempt the depoſition of his Father, was in their Divinity a good and godly Act. For</hi> Bajazet <hi>to take Arms againſt his Brother, was an abominable impiety.

But</hi> Bajazet <hi>miſcarries in his attempt againſt his Brother, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter was a proof ſufficient that God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with his attempt, it was not his will that he ſhould proſper. And ſeeing his will is the onely Rule of Goodneſſe, ſeeing he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate theſe two Princes, as he did</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau, <hi>the one to a good end, the other to an evill; the ſelf ſame Fact or attempt was good in the one, but wicked in the other.

But even this errour hath an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall which is worſe. They therefore meaſure all good and evil by the event, becauſe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all Events (without exception) to the irreſiſtible will of God, and think that nothing can fall out otherwiſe than it doth; becauſe every thing is irreſiſtibly appointed by Gods will, which in their Divinity, is ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Cauſe of Cauſes, and by Conſequence of all Effects, as the Author</hi>

                  <hi>But is the like ſinne or errour expreſly to be found in Iſrael? Do any make the ſame Fact for nature, quality and ſubſtance, to be no ſin in one man, and yet a ſin in another? or to be a little ſin in one men, and a grievous out-crying ſin in another? Though they do not avouch this of Rebellious attempts againſt Prince and State or of other like publick Facts, cognoſcible by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws; yet the Principles of</hi> Predeſtination <hi>commonly held by them and the</hi> Turk, <hi>draw them to the like inconveniences, in transforming the immutable Rule of Goodneſſe into the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of their partiall affections in other caſes.</hi>

                  <hi>The Adultery and Murder, which</hi> David <hi>committed, had been grievous ſins in another man, but in</hi> David <hi>being</hi> predeſtinated, <hi>they were but ſins of infirmity: ſins by which the outward man was defiled, not the inward man.

               <p n="1">1. Which ſide is it, that reſtrains Gods <hi>will</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of ſaving; to a <hi>few,</hi> even of thoſe, whom he calleth to ſalvation?

               </p>
               <p>But you argue (Section 33. <hi>He that ſaith [All that ever are ſanctified truly, ſhall be ſaved] doth more advance the grace of God, than be that ſaith [ſome that ſhall never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are ſanctified.]</hi> Anſw. 1. You muſt not obtrude a fallacy upon us, <hi>A dicto ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter:</hi> For <hi>all</hi> that are truely ſanctified ſhall be ſaved, Mat. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> But if they <hi>ceaſe</hi> to be ſanctified, the caſe is altered. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 18.24. 2 Pet. 2.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you ſpeak of advancing Gods grace, you may underſtand it, either of Gods <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> towards us, or of the <hi>effects</hi> thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome <hi>habit</hi> or <hi>quality,</hi> or <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> dwelling in us, or imprinted, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon us. If you take <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe; then indeed you may be ſaid to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> Gods grace, when you tell men, they may often <hi>commit fornication, revile and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

He makes man more ſinfull that places the originall fountain of his unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his <hi>own</hi> heart, than he that derives that uncleanneſſe unavoidably to him, through <hi>forreign</hi> channels, from a ſpring head, that was opened at a great diſtance from him, not onely befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to proceed; He that provides a faire and ſufficient excuſe for Mans ſin, doth make man <hi>leſſe</hi> ſinfull, than he that provides none, but chargeth all his ſin, with all the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, upon his own will; The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do the firſt, the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> the laſt. That God doth for the ſin of the <hi>firſt</hi> Parent, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:116027:309"/> man with an <hi>impotencie,</hi> or utter inability to believe and obey, and after that <hi>mulct</hi> of impotencie inflicted, that he doth require of him the <hi>Act</hi> of faith and obedience, which cannot be performed without a new power, He that delivers this Doctrine, makes man excuſable; The Reaſon is, there can be no better excuſe for the omiſſion of a duty, than an utter <hi>inability</hi> to perform it: and if <hi>he</hi> to whom the duty is ſuppoſed to be due hath inflicted that <hi>inability</hi> by way of puniſhment, before the obligation of the duty is of force, in all reaſon ſuch an obligation is to be <hi>void,</hi> and of <hi>none effect.</hi> For example; A Prince commits a ſon to priſon for his Fathers trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (which he will needs intail upon him,) gives order the man be put in irons, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under cuſtody; (and this is the <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> caſe, being tyed and bound in the chaine of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, and kept in thraldome under the power of the world and Satan); after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he cauſeth proclamation to be made to ſummon that priſoner to attend him at his <hi>Court,</hi> (though the former Decree for his reſtraint continues in full force irreverſibly) and in caſe he doth not make his appearance (which that Prince his own order and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant unrepealed, hath made impoſſible for him) this poore priſoner is ſentenced to have his preſent and unavoidable miſery aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:116027:310"/> by the acceſſion of new and greater torments. Now in this caſe, whether this priſoners <hi>non-appearance</hi> at <hi>Court;</hi> (for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience I cannot call it) ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a crime, or rather held altogether <hi>excuſable,</hi> and a miſery the more to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that it is unavoidable, I leave to every unbiaſſed judgement to determine. But this is according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as is evident from what hath been ſaid above.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that ſaith no man, whether <hi>Elect,</hi> or <hi>Reprobate,</hi> can abſtein from ſin, unleſſe he be kept back from ſinning, by a <hi>ſpeciall</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and in the <hi>intention</hi> of God, <hi>effectuall</hi> grace adminiſtred <hi>every</hi> moment, <hi>He,</hi> when man doth ſin, renders him <hi>excuſable.</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe his excuſe reſteth upon the <hi>defect</hi> of that Divine Grace, which <hi>defect</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the ſole will of God, and which (what ever it was in <hi>Adam</hi>) is not now in the power of man to hinder. But that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſay this, needs no other evidence than what hath been alleaged already. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make man <hi>leſſe</hi> ſinfull.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, in another ſenſe, you may be ſaid, to make man more ſinfull (as he that puts away his wife, is ſaid, (in the Phraſe of Scripture) to <hi>make</hi> her <hi>commit Adultery,</hi> Mat. 5.32.) For 1. the <hi>Non-elect</hi> you make (in
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:116027:310"/> this ſenſe) <hi>diſperately</hi> ſinfull: giving them too juſt an occaſion to take up that reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe wretches mentioned, Jer. 2.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 18.12. <hi>There is no hope, but we will walk after our own deviſes, and we will every one doe the imagination of his evill heart.</hi> Why ſhould I attend upon Gods Ordinances, reade, hear, pray, endeavour to mortifie luſts and appetites, and keep a good conſcience in all things, ſeeing theſe will (if not render me liable to a ſoarer judgement, and greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation) but make me inexcuſable; and not conduce at all, to my ſalvation, I being left in an utter <hi>incapacitie</hi> for that injoyment and happineſſe, by Gods <hi>eternall and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preterition?</hi> 2. As this Doctrine makes ſome men (All the <hi>Non-elect</hi>) more <hi>deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſinfull, ſo it tends to make others <hi>Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly</hi> ſinfull; for, as no ſin of <hi>theirs</hi> could hinder their <hi>election,</hi> that Decree for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation being irreſpectively made in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, from all eternity: ſo no ſins, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or how enormous ſoever (as was ſhewed above) can hinder their <hi>finall perſeverance;</hi> (that being an <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>neceſſary effect</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Decree</hi> of Election) and ſo all the ſins of perſons under that Decree, are reckoned but <hi>infirmities,</hi> or <hi>caſtigations</hi> proceeding from Gods paternall love (as M. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith) that ſhall never be able to <hi>excuſſe</hi> the ſpirit of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:116027:311"/> Grace, but ſerve rather to promote and confirm it, and likewiſe to advance their Glory.</p>
               <p>And yet, (notwithſtanding your Doctrine makes them thus p eſumptuouſly ſinfull; ſo fu l is it of contradictions, that) it makes them <hi>leſſe</hi> ſinfull too; for <hi>he</hi> whoſe ſins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exclude him from the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, certainly is leſſe ſinfull than he, whoſe ſins do exclude him from it, (elſe God ſhould not judge men according to their works) But the ſins of the <hi>Elect,</hi> whether Adultery, Murder, Perjury, Inceſt, or the like; cannot exclude them from the Kingdome of heaven; and yet the ſins of the <hi>Non-elect,</hi> their Adultery, Murder, Perjury, Inceſt, and the like do exclude them. If you ſay this is not from the nature of the ſin, but from Gods <hi>ſpeciall</hi> indulgence and favour.

No. In ſtead of a <hi>Solution</hi> to that purpoſe, here follows a clear <hi>Conceſſion,</hi> as if the <hi>Objection</hi> were a perfect Truth; For thus he proceeds, [<hi>And now the 0bjection being preſſed to ſuch a degree of impiety, that it doth tacitely lay the guilt of all mens Tranſgreſsions upon God, the Apoſtle thinks it high time to cut off all further arguing; which he doth in theſe words</hi>—Nay but what art thou, O Man, who replyeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God? As if he had ſaid —Doſt thou know who thou art, thou bold inquiſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or who it is thou dealeſt with?

            <p>For his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> on, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. I need ſay no more, then to evince, how palpably he miſtakes the ſenſe of the <hi>Text.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſhall not tyre you out, to examine a cloud of witneſſes, that might be produced in favour of the ſenſe which he rejects: but ſatisfie my ſelf, in diſcovering ſome of thoſe groſſe <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> which follow upon his interpretation. If by <hi>[Ordained to eternall life]</hi> we underſtand, <hi>[Abſolutely Elected;]</hi> then it will follow; (1.) That <hi>All</hi> the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated unto life, that were in this place, believed <hi>at once;</hi> And (2.) that thoſe which did believe, could not but believe; (3.) That All they who did now embrace the Faith, (upon this preaching of the Apoſtle) were <hi>Abſolutely</hi> Elected; and that not one of them could forſake the Faith, which he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; (4.) That this was <hi>revealed,</hi> not onely to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but to S. <hi>Luke</hi> alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Abſolute</hi> election of every <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall</hi> of theſe new <hi>Converts;</hi> How <hi>inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> are theſe inferences, and yet how <hi>Abſurd?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:116027:322"/> how ridiculous? On the other ſide, what ſhall we conclude of the reſt who did not <hi>believe</hi> at this Sermon? (1.) It followes, that they were All <hi>abſolutely</hi> Reprobated; and yet (2.) that God would have S. <hi>Paul</hi> command them All to believe in Chriſt; and (3.) that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he knew them to be <hi>Reprobates,</hi> and ſo in no <hi>capacitie</hi> to believe, and be ſaved, yet He calls them unto <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and (4.) threatens them with <hi>eternall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> for not believing; and (5.) afterwards upbraids them, that they judged themſelves unworthy of eternall life; and (6.) at laſt, when they would not believe, that he did, for that cauſe, turne to the Gentiles; what a heap of foule Abſurdities are here! And (which is none of the leaſt,) that S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould give notice, by this <hi>writing,</hi> That ſuch as now <hi>believed</hi> were all <hi>abſolutely</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the reſt abſolutely <hi>Reprobate</hi>); To what purpoſe ſhould this be? or what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could it have upon them? It could ſerve no end of Divine providence; but might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſerve the intereſt of <hi>Satan,</hi> as a means to tempt thoſe <hi>Believers</hi> to <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and the <hi>unbelievers</hi> to <hi>deſperation,</hi> and a contempt of thoſe <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which, (if this expoſition of the <hi>Text</hi> were true) they were aſſured by S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Teſtimony, could never bring them benefit.</p>
